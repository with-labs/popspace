Once they take that action, the log should go away.\n- `warn`: Use when a product feature may stop functioning correctly; unexpected\n  scenario.\n- `error`: Only use when user App would stop functioning correctly - super rare!\n\n## Log Format\n\nEach log will be formatted in the following manner:\n\n```typescript\n`[${new Date()}]  ${COMPONENT_NAME}: ${...args}`\n```",

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# Create React App preset for Storybook\n\nOne-line [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) configuration for Storybook.\n\nThis preset is designed to use alongside [`@storybook/react`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/app/react).\n\n## Basic usage\n\n**Note: you don't need to do this manually** if you used `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init` on a create-react-app, everything should properly setup already ✅.\n\nFirst, install this preset to your project.\n\n```sh\n# Yarn\nyarn add -D @storybook/preset-create-react-app\n\n# npm\nnpm install -D @storybook/preset-create-react-app\n```\n\nOnce installed, add this preset to the appropriate file:\n\n- `./.storybook/main.js` (for Storybook 5.3.0 and newer)\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = {\n    addons: ['@storybook/preset-create-react-app'],\n  };\n  ```\n\n- `./.storybook/presets.js` (for all Storybook versions)\n\n  ```js\n  module.exports = ['@storybook/preset-create-react-app'];\n  ```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Usage with Docs\n\nWhen working with Storybook Docs, simply add the following config to your `main.js` file.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  addons: [\n    '@storybook/preset-create-react-app',\n    {\n      name: '@storybook/addon-docs',\n      options: {\n        configureJSX: true,\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### CRA overrides\n\nThis preset uses CRA's Webpack/Babel configurations, so that Storybook's behavior matches your app's behavior.\n\nHowever, there may be some cases where you'd rather override CRA's default behavior. If that is something you need, you can use the `craOverrides` object.\n\n| Option               | Default          | Behaviour | Type       | Description                                                                                                        |\n| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `fileLoaderExcludes` | `['ejs', 'mdx']` | Extends   | `string[]` | Excludes file types (by extension) from CRA's `file-loader` configuration. The defaults are required by Storybook. |\n\nHere's how you might configure this preset to ignore PDF files so they can be processed by another preset or loader:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  addons: [\n    {\n      name: '@storybook/preset-create-react-app',\n      options: {\n        craOverrides: {\n          fileLoaderExcludes: ['pdf'],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Custom `react-scripts` packages\n\nIn most cases, this preset will find your `react-scripts` package, even if it's a fork of the offical `react-scripts`.\n\nIn the event that it doesn't, you can set the package's name with `scriptsPackageName`.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  addons: [\n    {\n      name: '@storybook/preset-create-react-app',\n      options: {\n        scriptsPackageName: '@my/react-scripts',\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Warning for forks of 'react-scripts'\n\nOne of the tasks that this preset does is inject the storybook config directory (the default is `.storybook`)\ninto the `includes` key of the webpack babel-loader config that react-scripts (or your fork) provides. This is\nnice because then any components/code you've defined in your storybook config directory will be run through the\nbabel-loader as well.\n\nThe potential gotcha exists if you have tweaked the Conditions of the webpack babel-loader rule in your fork of\nreact-scripts. This preset will make the `include` condition an array (if not already), and inject the storybook\nconfig directory. If you have changed the conditions to utilize an `exclude`, then BOTH conditions will need to\nbe true (which isn't likely going to work as expected).\n\nThe steps to remedy this would be to follow the steps for customizing the webpack config within the storybook\nside of things. [Details for storybook custom webpack config](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configurations/custom-webpack-config/)\nYou'll have access to all of the rules in `config.module.rules`. You'll need to find the offending rule,\nand customize it how you need it to be to be compatible with your fork.\n\nSee [Webpack Rule Conditions](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rule-conditions) for more details\nconcerning the conditions.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Walkthrough to set up Storybook Docs with CRA & typescript](https://gist.github.com/shilman/bc9cbedb2a7efb5ec6710337cbd20c0c)\n- [Example projects (used for testing this preset)](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/examples)",

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n##  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n##  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n##  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n##  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n##  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n##  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "description": "Extra assertions on top of node's assert module",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# assert-plus\n\nThis library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two\nthings: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable\nNODE\\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like\n`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nYou can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):\n\n```javascript\n    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');\n```\n\nLastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the\nenvironment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# ast-types-flow\n\nFlow types for the Javascript AST. Based off of [benjamn/ast-types](https://github.com/benjamn/ast-types).\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst install `ast-types-flow` via npm, then you can import any of the types\nthat are exported.\n\n```javascript\n/* @flow */\n\nimport type {Node} from 'ast-types-flow';\n\nfunction getName(node: Node): string {\n  switch (node.type) {\n    case 'Identifier':\n      return node.name;\n\n    case 'ClassDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Error, id could be null.\n\n    case 'FunctionDeclaration':\n      return node.id.name; // Fine if it's always there.\n\n    case 'FunctionExpression':\n      if (node.id) {\n        return node.id.name; // Can refine id to make sure it exists.\n      } else {\n        return 'Unknown';\n      }\n\n    case 'Literal':\n      return node.name; // Error, Literals don't have names, don't be silly.\n  }\n  return 'Unknown';\n}\n```\n\n## How it works\n\nA notion of \"extends\" is added to the Flow syntax via comments. A transform is\nincluded that will compile the source code into useful disjoint union types\nbased on how the different types extend each other. For example:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  common: string,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  // extends Node\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  // extends Node\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nWill be transformed into:\n\n```javascript\ntype Node = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n} | {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Bar: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n\ntype Foo = {\n  type: 'Foo',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  foo: string,\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  type: 'Bar',\n  _Foo: void,\n  common: string,\n  bar: number,\n};\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n\n1. The type `Node` would more ideally be compiled into `Foo | Bar` but then the\ndisjoint union cannot be properly refined. For now we have to duplicate the\ncomplete definitions.\n2. Each entry in a disjoint union has to be structurally unique or Flow will\nhave an error on the definition. That is why the private `_Foo: void` fields\nappear in the types.",

Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\n     this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\n     distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n     Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\n     Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n        its Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n     or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n     the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n     License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\n     permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n     Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to\n     grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\n     applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\n     equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\n     the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\n     Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\n     License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\n     attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\n     Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the\n        recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n     the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\n     Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\n     Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\n     License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n     under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n     the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\n     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\n     License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n     (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or\n     limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the\n     Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the\n     extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\n     behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\n     such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\n     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\n   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\n   this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the\n   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a\n   text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under\n   this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,\n   such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary\n   skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing\n     basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into\n     compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are\n     reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the\n     non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have\n     received notice of non-compliance with this License from such\n     Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt\n     of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n     counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\n     You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n     2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis,\n   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,\n   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free\n   of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.\n   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software\n   is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,\n   You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,\n   repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential\n   part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under\n   this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\n   such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\n   limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\n   incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\n   not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts\n   of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of\n   business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\n   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing\n   in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or\n   counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\n   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that\n   the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not\n   be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n      10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\n      publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\n      distinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\n      You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n      of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n      or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\n      steward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\n      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n      create a new license for such software, you may create and use a\n      modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\n      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\n      such modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\n      Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n      Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\n      the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be\n      attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is subject to the\n      terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.\n      2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not\n      distributed with this file, You can\n      obtain one at\n      http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,\nthen You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a\nrelevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a\nnotice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - \"Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\" Notice\n\n      This Source Code Form is \"Incompatible\n      With Secondary Licenses\", as defined by\n      the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.",

    "licenseText": "# babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread\n\n> This plugin allows Babel to transform rest properties for object destructuring assignment and spread properties for object literals.\n\n## Example\n\n### Rest Properties\n\n```js\nlet { x, y, ...z } = { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 };\nconsole.log(x); // 1\nconsole.log(y); // 2\nconsole.log(z); // { a: 3, b: 4 }\n```\n\n### Spread Properties\n\n```js\nlet n = { x, y, ...z };\nconsole.log(n); // { x: 1, y: 2, a: 3, b: 4 }\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)\n\n**.babelrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\"transform-object-rest-spread\"]\n}\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-object-rest-spread script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-object-rest-spread\"]\n});\n```\n\n## Options\n\n### `useBuiltIns`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`.\n\nBy default, this plugin uses Babel's `extends` helper which polyfills `Object.assign`. Enabling this option will use `Object.assign` directly.\n\n**.babelrc**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-object-rest-spread\", { \"useBuiltIns\": true }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**In**\n\n```js\nz = { x, ...y };\n```\n\n**Out**\n\n```js\nz = Object.assign({ x }, y);\n```\n\n## References\n\n* [Proposal: Object Rest/Spread Properties for ECMAScript](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread)\n* [Spec](http://sebmarkbage.github.io/ecmascript-rest-spread)",

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# BSER Binary Serialization\n\nBSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.\nBSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of\nencoded values.\n\nIt is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary\nwith no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating\nsystem filename storage.\n\nFor more details about the serialization scheme see\n[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).\n\n## API\n\n```js\nvar bser = require('bser');\n```\n\n### bser.loadFromBuffer\n\nThe is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,\ndecodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the\ninput is invalid.\n\n```js\nvar obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);\n```\n\n### bser.dumpToBuffer\n\nSynchronously encodes a value as BSER.\n\n```js\nvar encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);\nconsole.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']\n```\n\n### BunserBuf\n\nThe asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.\nYou may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the\ndecoded values via its `value` event.\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log(obj);\n});\n```\n\nThen in your socket `data` event:\n\n```js\nbunser.append(buf);\n```\n\n## Example\n\nRead BSER from socket:\n\n```js\nvar bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();\n\nbunser.on('value', function(obj) {\n  console.log('data from socket', obj);\n});\n\nvar socket = net.connect('/socket');\n\nsocket.on('data', function(buf) {\n  bunser.append(buf);\n});\n```\n\nWrite BSER to socket:\n\n```js\nsocket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));\n```",

Our licenses are\n     irrevocable.

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install chokidar\n```\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”).

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3.

In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n      communicate, and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n      in a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non\ntransferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional\nlicense to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in\nall territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable\nlaw or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or\nfuture medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose\nwhatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the “License”). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date\nCC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the\nLicense, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)\nexercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work\nor (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the\nWork, in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\n      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory\n      or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\n      this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttps://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

Most of\nthe curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective\nor extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.\n\nAll operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is\nprovided by [hash.js][2]\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both\n  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for\n  node)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2014.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Available in npm as *errno*.\n\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rvagg/node-errno)\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/errno.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errno)\n\n* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)\n* [Custom errors](#customerrors)\n\n<a name=\"errnoexposed\"></a>\n## errno exposed\n\nEver find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

    "licenseText": "# estree-walker\n\nSimple utility for walking an [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree)-compliant AST, such as one generated by [acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm i estree-walker\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar walk = require( 'estree-walker' ).walk;\nvar acorn = require( 'acorn' );\n\nast = acorn.parse( sourceCode, options ); // https://github.com/acornjs/acorn\n\nwalk( ast, {\n  enter: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {\n    // some code happens\n  },\n  leave: function ( node, parent, prop, index ) {\n  \t// some code happens\n  }\n});\n```\n\nInside the `enter` function, calling `this.skip()` will prevent the node's children being walked, or the `leave` function (which is optional) being called.\n\n\n## Why not use estraverse?\n\nThe ESTree spec is evolving to accommodate ES6/7. I've had a couple of experiences where [estraverse](https://github.com/estools/estraverse) was unable to handle an AST generated by recent versions of acorn, because it hard-codes visitor keys.\n\nestree-walker, by contrast, simply enumerates a node's properties to find child nodes (and child lists of nodes), and is therefore resistant to spec changes. It's also much smaller. (The performance, if you're wondering, is basically identical.)\n\nNone of which should be taken as criticism of estraverse, which has more features and has been battle-tested in many more situations, and for which I'm very grateful.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

If you are instead interested in using a Node.js\nSDK which grants you admin access from a privileged environment (like a server),\nyou should use the\n[Firebase Admin Node.js SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n## Get the code (browser)\n\n### Script include\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize download size by only including the scripts you need.\n\nInclude Firebase in your web application via a `<script>` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${JSCORE_VERSION}/firebase.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({\n    apiKey: '<your-api-key>',\n    authDomain: '<your-auth-domain>',\n    databaseURL: '<your-database-url>',\n    projectId: '<your-cloud-firestore-project>',\n    storageBucket: '<your-storage-bucket>',\n    messagingSenderId: '<your-sender-id>'\n  });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\n_Note: To get a filled in version of the above code snippet, go to the\n[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your app and click on \"Add\nFirebase to your web app\"._\n\n### npm bundler (Browserify, Webpack, etc.)\n\n>This brings in all Firebase features. See\n>[\"Include only the features you need\"](#include-only-the-features-you-need)\n>below for\n>how to minimize bundle size by only importing the features you need.\n\nThe Firebase JavaScript npm package contains code that can be run in the browser\nafter combining the modules you use with a package bundler (e.g.,\n[Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)).\n\nInstall the Firebase npm module:\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using ES6 imports or TypeScript:\n\n```js\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase';\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\n### Include only the features you need\n\nThe full Firebase JavaScript client includes support for Firebase Authentication, the\nFirebase Realtime Database, Firebase Storage, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Including\ncode via the above snippets will pull in all of these features.\n\nYou can reduce the amount of code your app uses by just including the features\nyou need. The individually installable services are:\n\n- `firebase-app` - The core `firebase` client (required).\n- `firebase-auth` - Firebase Authentication (optional).\n- `firebase-database` - The Firebase Realtime Database (optional).\n- `firebase-firestore` - Cloud Firestore (optional).\n- `firebase-storage` - Firebase Storage (optional).\n- `firebase-messaging` - Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional).\n- `firebase-functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions (optional).\n\nFrom the CDN, include the individual services you use (include `firebase-app`\nfirst):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-auth.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-database.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-storage.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-messaging.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-functions.js\"></script>\n\n<script>\n  var app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n  // ...\n</script>\n```\n\nWhen using the firebase npm package, you can `require()` just the services that\nyou use:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase/app');\nrequire('firebase/auth');\nrequire('firebase/database');\n\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n```\n\nIf you are using TypeScript with the npm package, you can import just the\nservices you use:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace along with all its type information.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_The type information from the import statement will include all of the SDKs,\nnot just the ones you have `required`, so you could get a runtime error if you\nreference a non-required service._\n\n## Get the code (Node.js - server and command line)\n\n### NPM\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many\ndevelopers want to write server applications or command-line utilities using the\nNode.js JavaScript runtime.\n\nYou can use the same npm module to use Firebase in the Node.js runtime (on a\nserver or running from the command line):\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nvar firebase = require('firebase');\nvar app = firebase.initializeApp({ ... });\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are using native ES6 module with --experimental-modules flag (or Node 12+)\nyou should do:\n\n```js\n// This import loads the firebase namespace.\nimport * as firebase from 'firebase/app';\n\n// These imports load individual services into the firebase namespace.\nimport 'firebase/auth';\nimport 'firebase/database';\n```\n\n_Known issue for typescript users with --experimental-modules: you have to set allowSyntheticDefaultImports to true in tsconfig.json to pass the type check. Use it with caution since it makes the assumption that all modules have a default export, which might not be the case for the other dependencies you have. And Your code will break if you try to import the default export from a module that doesn't have default export._\n\nFirebase Storage is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[`google-cloud` Node.js client](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node).\n\n```\n$ npm install --save google-cloud\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access your Storage bucket using:\n\n```js\nvar gcloud = require('google-cloud')({ ... });\nvar gcs = gcloud.storage();\nvar bucket = gcs.bucket('<your-firebase-storage-bucket>');\n...\n```\n\nFirebase Cloud Messaging is not included in the server side Firebase npm module.\nInstead, you can use the\n[Firebase Cloud Messaging Rest API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message).\n\n## API definition\n\nIf you use the\n[Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) or\ncompatible IDE, you can find API definitions for all the Firebase JavaScript API\nin the included `/externs` directory in this package:\n\n```\nexterns/\n  firebase-app-externs.js\n  firebase-auth-externs.js\n  firebase-database-externs.js\n  firebase-firestore-externs.js\n  firebase-storage-externs.js\n  firebase-messaging-externs.js\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe Firebase changelog can be found at\n[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js).\n\n## Browser/environment compatibility\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2017 Kirollos Risk\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

    "licenseText": "# Growly #\n\nSimple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.\n\n## Installation ##\n\nInstall growly using `npm`:\n\n```\nnpm install growly\n```\n\nAnd then require it:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n```\n\nThis module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.\n\n## Example ##\n\nSending a minimal Growl notification:\n\n```javascript\nvar growly = require('growly');\n\ngrowly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });\n```\n\nMore examples can be found in the *example/* directory.\n\n## Usage ##\n\nThe growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.\n\n### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###\n\nRegisters a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.\n\n  - `appname` the name of the application (required.)\n  - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.\n  - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:\n    - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)\n    - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)\n    - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)\n  - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\ngrowly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [\n    { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },\n    { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }\n], function(err) {\n    console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###\n\nSends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.\n\n  - `text` the body of the notification.\n  - `opts` an object with the following properties:\n    - `.title` title of the notification.\n    - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.\n    - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)\n    - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)\n    - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).\n    - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.\n  - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)\n\nAn example:\n\n```javascript\n/* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */\ngrowly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {\n    console.log('Action:', action);\n});\n```\n\n### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###\n\nSet the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect.png)](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect)\n\nThis is a shim for the ECMAScript 6 [Reflect](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object) and [Proxy](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-proxy-objects) objects.\n\nThis library does two things:\n\n  - It defines an ES6-compliant `Reflect` global object that exports the ECMAScript 6 reflection API.\n  - If harmony-era (pre-ES6) `Proxy` support is available, it patches `Proxy` to be up-to-date with the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).\n\n**July 2016 update**: the most recent version of all major browsers and node.js now [support fully\nES6-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Proxy) `Reflect` and `Proxy` objects. This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect`\nsupport on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want\nES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.\n\n**May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.\n\nRead [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nFor node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n    npm install harmony-reflect\n\nThen:\n\n    node --harmony-proxies\n    > var Reflect = require('harmony-reflect');\n\nSee [release notes](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/blob/master/RELNOTES.md) for changes to the npm releases.\n\nTo use in a browser, just download the single reflect.js file. After loading\n\n    <script src=\"reflect.js\"></script>\n\na global object `Reflect` is defined that contains reflection methods as defined in the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object).\n\nThis library also updates the \"harmony-era\" `Proxy` object in the V8 engine\n(also used in node.js) to follow the latest [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) spec.\nTo create such a proxy, call:\n\n    var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);\n\nSee below for a list of spec incompatibilities and other gotcha's.\n\nAPI Docs\n========\n\nThis module exports an object named `Reflect` and updates the global `Proxy` object (if it exists) to be compatible with the latest ECMAScript 6 spec.\n\nThe ECMAScript 6 Proxy API allows one to intercept various operations on Javascript objects.\n\n  * Overview of all [supported traps](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/traps.md) on proxies\n  * The [Reflect API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/api.md) \n  * The Proxy [Handler API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/handler_api.md)\n  \nCompatibility\n=============\n\nThe `Reflect` API, with support for proxies, was tested on:\n\n  * Firefox (>= v4.0)\n  * `node --harmony_proxies` (>= v0.7.8)\n  * `iojs --harmony_proxies` (>= 2.3.0)\n  * `v8 --harmony_proxies` (>= v3.6)\n  * Any recent `js` spidermonkey shell\n\nIf you need only `Reflect` and not an up-to-date `Proxy` object, this\nlibrary should work on any modern ES5 engine (including all browsers).\n\nCompatibility notes:\n\n  * Chrome (>= v19 && <= v37) used to support proxies behind a flag\n    (`chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`) but Chrome v38  [removed](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1543#c44) the `Proxy` constructor. As a result, this library cannot patch the harmony-era `Proxy` object on Chrome v38 or above. If you're working with Chromium directly, it's still possible to enable proxies using `chromium-browser --js-flags=\"--harmony_proxies\"`.\n  * In older versions of V8, the `Proxy` constructor was enabled by\n    default when starting V8 with `--harmony`. For recent versions of V8,\n    `Proxy` must be explicitly enabled with `--harmony_proxies`.\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n  *  ECMAScript 5/strict\n  *  To emulate direct proxies:\n    *  old Harmony [Proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies)\n    *  Harmony [WeakMaps](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps)\n\nAfter loading `reflect.js` into your page or other JS environment, be aware that the following globals are patched to be able to recognize emulated direct proxies:\n\n    Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor\n    Object.defineProperty\n    Object.defineProperties\n    Object.getOwnPropertyNames\n    Object.getOwnPropertySymbols\n    Object.keys\n    Object.{get,set}PrototypeOf\n    Object.assign\n    Object.{freeze,seal,preventExtensions}\n    Object.{isFrozen,isSealed,isExtensible}\n    Object.prototype.valueOf\n    Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf\n    Object.prototype.toString\n    Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty\n    Function.prototype.toString\n    Date.prototype.toString\n    Array.isArray\n    Array.prototype.concat\n    Proxy\n    Reflect\n\n:warning: In node.js, when you `require('harmony-reflect')`, only the current\nmodule's globals are patched. If you pass an emulated direct proxy to an external module, and that module uses the unpatched globals, the module may not interact with the proxy according to the latest ES6 Proxy API, instead falling\nback on the old pre-ES6 Proxy API. This can cause bugs, e.g. the built-in `Array.isArray` will return `false` when passed a proxy-for-array, while the\npatched `Array.isArray` will return true. I know of no good fix to reliably patch the globals for all node modules. If you do, let me know.\n\nExamples\n========\n\nThe [examples](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/examples) directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of proxies:\n\n  * membranes: wrappers that transitively isolate two object-graphs.\n  * observer: a self-hosted implementation of the ES7 `Object.observe` notification mechanism.\n  * profiler: a simple profiler to collect usage statistics of an object.\n\nOther example uses of proxies (not done by me, but using this library):\n\n  * supporting [negative array indices](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array) a la Python\n  * [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): using proxies to correct typo's in JS property names\n  * [persistent objects](http://tagtree.tv/es6-proxies): shows how one might go about using proxies to save updates to objects in a database incrementally\n  * [defaultdict](https://github.com/greenify/defaultdict2): default values for new keys in objects (as known from Python)\n\nFor more examples of proxies, and a good overview of their design rationale, I recommend reading [Axel Rauschmayer's blog post on proxies](http://www.2ality.com/2014/12/es6-proxies.html).\n\nProxy Handler API\n=================\n\nThe sister project [proxy-handlers](https://github.com/tvcutsem/proxy-handlers)\ndefines a number of predefined Proxy handlers as \"abstract classes\" that your \ncode can \"subclass\" The goal is to minimize the number of traps that your proxy\nhandlers must implement.\n\nSpec Incompatibilities and other gotcha's\n=========================================\n\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2016 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html) as follows:\n\n  * In ES7, the `enumerate()` trap, and the corresponding `Reflect.enumerate()` method, have been [removed](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/161).\n    This shim still supports the trap.\n  * The ES7 (and ES6) spec contains a \n    [bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666) that leads to missing\n    invariant checks in the getOwnPropertyDescriptor, defineProperty and deleteProperty traps. This library already contains the patch referred\n    to in [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666).\n\nThis library differs from the [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) as follows:\n\n  * In ES6, `Proxy` is a constructor function that _requires_ the use\n    of `new`. That is, you must write `new Proxy(target, handler)`. This library\n    exports `Proxy` as an ordinary function which may be called with or without using the `new` operator.\n    \n  * In ES6, `Function.prototype.toString` and `Date.prototype.toString` do not\n    operate transparently on Proxies. This shim patches those functions so that\n    stringifying a Proxy-for-a-function or a Proxy-for-a-date \"unwraps\" the\n    proxy and instead stringifies the target of the Proxy. This behavior may\n    change in the future to be more spec-compatible.\n    \n  * This library does not shim [Symbol objects](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-symbol-objects).\n    On modern V8 or io.js which supports Symbol objects natively, due to a bug in V8, Symbols and Proxies\n    don't play well together. [Read more](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/57).\n  \n  * Proxies-for-arrays are serialized as JSON objects rather than as JSON arrays. That is, `JSON.stringify(new Proxy([], {}))` returns \"{}\" rather than \"[]\". [Read more]( https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/13#issuecomment-17249465).",

    "description": "Parses well-formed HTML (meaning all tags closed) into an AST and back. quickly.",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# html-parse-stringify\n\nThis is an _experimental lightweight approach_ to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.\n\nAs it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.\n\n\"Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!\"\n\nWhy yes, yes I have :)\n\nBut the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?\n\nYes.\n\nReact.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a \"virtual DOM\" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.\n\nAs a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something's changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.\n\nCool idea, right?!\n\n## So why this?\n\nWell, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don't like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.\n\nIf, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by _whatever_ templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you'd get the same benefit, sans React's impositions.\n\nThis may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).\n\nBut you can't just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).\n\nThis lib does exactly that.\n\nIt has two methods:\n\n1. parse\n2. stringify\n\n## `.parse(htmlString, options)`\n\nTakes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.\n\n## `.stringify(AST)`\n\nTakes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.\n\n## What does the AST look like?\n\nSee comments in the following example:\n\n```js\nvar HTML = require('html-parse-stringify')\n\n// this html:\nvar html = '<div class=\"oh\"><p>hi</p></div>'\n\n// becomes this AST:\nvar ast = HTML.parse(html)\n\nconsole.log(ast)\n/*\n{\n    // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`\n    type: 'tag',\n\n    // name of tag if relevant\n    name: 'div',\n    \n    // parsed attribute object\n    attrs: {\n        class: 'oh'\n    },\n\n    // whether this is a self-closing tag\n    // such as <img/>\n    voidElement: false,\n\n    // an array of child nodes\n    // we see the same structure\n    // repeated in each of these\n    children: [\n        {\n            type: 'tag',\n            name: 'p',\n            attrs: {},\n            voidElement: false,\n            children: [\n                // this is a text node\n                // it also has a `type`\n                // but nothing other than\n                // a `content` containing\n                // its text.\n                {\n                    type: 'text',\n                    content: 'hi'\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n*/\n```\n\n## the AST node types\n\n### 1. tag\n\nproperties:\n\n- `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node\n- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'\n- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: \"class1 class2\"`\n- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).\n- `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.\n\n### 2. text\n\nproperties:\n\n- `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node\n- `content` - text content of the node\n\n### 3. component\n\nIf you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won't keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.\n\nThis is so that it's possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another \"subview\" in your application that handles it's own DOM diffing.\n\nproperties:\n\n- `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node\n- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'\n- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: \"class1 class2\"`\n- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).\n- `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.\n\n## changelog\n\n- `3.0.1` Merged #47 which makes void elements check case insensitive. Thanks again, [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!\n- `3.0.0` Merged #46 which fixed an issue with handling of whitespace. Doing major version bump since this changes behavior if you have whitespace only nodes (see merged PR and #45 for more details). Thanks [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!\n- `2.1.1` Merged #41 which fixed an issue with tag nesting. Thanks [@ericponto](https://github.com/ericponto).\n- `2.1.0` Merged support for numeric tags. This allows a use case described in [this PR](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify/pull/43). Thanks [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev).\n- `2.0.3` Fixed failed publish. Accidentally published an empty package :sweat_smile:\n- `2.0.2` Fixed incorrect attribution for vulnerability disclosure. The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li. Sam Sanoop was the one who reached out to me about it.\n- `2.0.1` Addressing a reported regular expression denial of service issue found by [Yeting Li](https://github.com/yetingli) and reported to me by [Sam Sanoop](https://twitter.com/snoopysecurity) of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) THANK YOU!. The issue was that sending certain input would cause one of the regular expressions we used to lock up and not finish, freezing the process. See the test that was added for details. To be clear, this lib wasn't meant for parsing non-well formed HTML. But, better safe than sorry! So we're fixing it.\n- `2.0.0` updated to more modern dependencies/build system. Switched to prettier, etc. No big feature differences, just new build system/project structure. Added support for top level text nodes thanks to @jperl. Added support for comments thanks to @pconerly.\n- `1.0.0 - 1.0.3` no big changes, bug fixes and speed improvements.\n\n## credits\n\nIf this sounds interesting you should probably follow [@HenrikJoreteg](https://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg) and [@Philip_Roberts](https://twitter.com/philip_roberts) on twitter to see how this all turns out.\n\n## license\n\nMIT",

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "description": "An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Licensors may therefore wish\nto use this license together with another license for the contents.\n\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrademark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\nactivities not covered by this License.\n\n------\n\nThe Licensor (as defined below) \n\nand \n\nYou (as defined below) \n\nagree as follows: \n\n### 1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n\n\"Collective Database\" - Means this Database in unmodified form as part\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\nassembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective\nDatabase will not be considered a Derivative Database.\n\n\"Convey\" - As a verb, means Using the Database, a Derivative Database,\nor the Database as part of a Collective Database in any way that enables\na Person to make or receive copies of the Database or a Derivative\nDatabase.  Conveying does not include interaction with a user through a\ncomputer network, or creating and Using a Produced Work, where no\ntransfer of a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database occurs.\n\n\"Contents\" - The contents of this Database, which includes the\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.\n\n\"Database\" - A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.\n\n\"Database Directive\" - Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.\n\n\"Database Right\" - Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4. \n\n\"Derivative Database\" - Means a database based upon the Database, and\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\nDatabase.\n\n\"Extraction\" - Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in\nany form.\n\n\"License\" - Means this license agreement and is both a license of rights\nsuch as copyright and Database Rights and an agreement in contract.\n\n\"Licensor\" - Means the Person that offers the Database under the terms\nof this License. \n\n\"Person\" - Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons\ncorporate or incorporate.\n\n\"Produced Work\" -  a work (such as an image, audiovisual material, text,\nor sounds) resulting from using the whole or a Substantial part of the\nContents (via a search or other query) from this Database, a Derivative\nDatabase, or this Database as part of a Collective Database.  \n\n\"Publicly\" - means to Persons other than You or under Your control by\neither more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their\nactivities (such as contracting with an independent consultant). \n\n\"Re-utilisation\" - means any form of making available to the public all\nor a Substantial part of the Contents by the distribution of copies, by\nrenting, by online or other forms of transmission.\n\n\"Substantial\" - Means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a\ncombination of both. The repeated and systematic Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may amount to the\nExtraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the Contents.\n\n\"Use\" - As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright\nor Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and\nincludes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,\npublicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as\nwell as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it\nin a different mode or format. \n\n\"You\" - Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\nDatabase, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa.\n\n### 2.0 What this License covers\n\n2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:\n\n  a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\n\n  b. A license of the Database Right; and\n\n  c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\n\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\nDatabase, including:\n\n  a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\n  The copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\n  Database, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\n  independent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\n  law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\n  model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\n  of the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\n  indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\n  Contents stored in the Database;\n\n  b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\n  Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\n  Database Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\n  Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\n  from the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\n  not infringe any applicable copyright; and\n\n  c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\n  access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\n  use on this access as outlined in this License. \n\n2.3 Rights not covered. \n\n  a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\n  or operation of the Database; \n\n  b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\n  Database; and\n\n  c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\n  Database. \n\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\nthe rights over the images.  \n\n### 3.0 Rights granted\n\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\nfuture. \n\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\n\n  a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\n  the Contents;\n\n  b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\n\n  c. Creation of Collective Databases;\n\n  d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\n  in any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\n  Databases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\n\n  e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\n  performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\n  part, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\n  Databases.\n\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n  a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\n  the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n  of the rights granted under this License;\n\n  b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n  which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n  compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\n  the rights granted under this License; and,\n\n  c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n  royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\n  a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\n  schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n  granted under this License.\n\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\n\n### 4.0 Conditions of Use\n\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\nin material breach of its terms.\n\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\nmust: \n\n  a. Do so only under the terms of this License;\n\n  b. Include a copy of this License or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n  with the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\n  Database or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; \n\n  c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\n  that refer to this License; and\n\n  d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\n  file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\n  location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\n  look for it.\n\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\nis available under this License.\n\n  a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\n  Section 4.3:\n\n        Contains information from DATABASE NAME which is made available\n        under the ODC Attribution License.\n\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\nhyperlink to the location of the Database. \"ODC Attribution License\"\nshould contain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\nrequired URI's with the above notice.\n\n4.4 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.\n\n### 5.0 Moral rights\n\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author's honour and reputation, or\nany other derogatory treatment:\n\n  a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\n  all moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\n  extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\n  10.4; \n\n  b. If waiver of moral rights under Section 5.1 a in the relevant\n  jurisdiction is not possible, Licensor agrees not to assert any moral\n  rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the\n  fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under\n  Section 10.4; and\n\n  c. For jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert\n  moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their\n  moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.\n\nPlease note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.\n\n### 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected \n\n6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without limitation:\n\n  a. Exceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents\n  from non-electronic Databases for private purposes, Extraction for\n  purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and\n  Extraction or Re-utilisation for public security or an administrative\n  or judicial procedure. \n\n  b. Fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognised limitation\n  or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws. \n\n6.2 This License does not affect any rights of lawful users to Extract\nand Re-utilise insubstantial parts of the Contents, evaluated\nquantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including\ncreating a Derivative Database (subject to other rights over the\nContents, see Section 2.4). The repeated and systematic Extraction or\nRe-utilisation of insubstantial parts of the Contents may however amount\nto the Extraction or Re-utilisation of a Substantial part of the\nContents.\n\n### 7.0 Warranties and Disclaimer\n\n7.1 The Database is licensed by the Licensor \"as is\" and without any\nwarranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute,\ncustom, course of dealing, or trade usage. Licensor specifically\ndisclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title,\nnon-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of\nerrors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so\nthis exclusion may not apply to You.\n\n### 8.0 Limitation of liability\n\n8.1 Subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law,\nthe Licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability\nfor loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use\nunder this License, whether by You or by anyone else, and whether caused\nby any fault on the part of the Licensor or not. This exclusion of\nliability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental,\nconsequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue,\ndata, anticipated profits, and lost business. This exclusion applies\neven if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such\ndamages.\n\n8.2 If liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and\ndirect financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on\nthe part of the Licensor.\n\n### 9.0 Termination of Your rights under this License\n\n9.1 Any breach by You of the terms and conditions of this License\nautomatically terminates this License with immediate effect and without\nnotice to You. For the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\nunder Section 4.8 of this License.  Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will\nsurvive any termination of this License.\n\n9.2 If You are not in breach of the terms of this License, the Licensor\nwill not terminate Your rights under it. \n\n9.3 Unless terminated under Section 9.1, this License is granted to You\nfor the duration of applicable rights in the Database. \n\n9.4 Reinstatement of rights. If you cease any breach of the terms and\nconditions of this License, then your full rights under this License\nwill be reinstated:\n\n  a. Provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th\n  day after cessation of breach; \n\n  b. Permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless\n  otherwise reasonably notified by the Licensor; or\n\n  c.  Permanently if reasonably notified by the Licensor of the\n  violation, this is the first time You have received notice of\n  violation of this License from  the Licensor, and You cure the\n  violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\n\n9.5 Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release\nthe Database under different license terms or to stop distributing or\nmaking available the Database. Releasing the Database under different\nlicense terms or stopping the distribution of the Database will not\nwithdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\nrequired to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\nLicense will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\nstated above.\n\n### 10.0 General\n\n10.1 If any provision of this License is held to be invalid or\nunenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms and conditions of this License and each\nremaining provision of this License shall be valid and enforced to the\nfullest extent permitted by law. \n\n10.2 This License is the entire agreement between the parties with\nrespect to the rights granted here over the Database. It replaces any\nearlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to\nthe Database. \n\n10.3 If You are in breach of the terms of this License, You will not be\nentitled to rely on the terms of this License or to complain of any\nbreach by the Licensor. \n\n10.4 Choice of law. This License takes effect in and will be governed by\nthe laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\nsought to be enforced. If the standard suite of rights granted under\napplicable copyright law and Database Rights in the relevant\njurisdiction includes additional rights not granted under this License,\nthese additional rights are granted in this License in order to meet the\nterms of this License.",

For formatting according to common conventions, see `tag.format`.\n\n### tags(tag) ###\n\nCheck whether a hyphen-separated tag is valid and well-formed. Always returns a `Tag`, which can be checked using the `valid` method.\n\n### tags.check(tag) ###\n\nShortcut for `tags(tag).valid()`. Return `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise. For meaningful error output see `tag.errors()`.\n\n### tags.subtags(subtag), tags.subtags(subtags) ###\n\nLook up one or more subtags. Returns an array of `Subtag` objects. Returns an empty array if all of the subtags are non-existent.\n\nCalling `tags.subtags('mt')` will return an array with two `Subtag` objects: one for Malta (the 'region' type subtag) and one for Maltese (the 'language' type subtag).\n\n```\n> tags.subtags('mt');\n[Subtag, Subtag]\n> tags.subtags('bumblebee');\n[]\n```\n\nTo get or check a single subtag by type use `tags.language(subtag)`, `tags.region(subtag)` or `tags.type(subtag, type)`.\n\n### tags.filter(subtags) ###\n\nThe opposite of `tags.subtags(subtags)`. Returns an array of codes that are not registered subtags, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n```\n> tags.filter(['en', 'Aargh']);\n['Aargh']\n```\n\n### tags.search(description, [all]) ###\n\nSearch for tags and subtags by description. Supports either a RegExp object or a string for `description`. Returns an array of `Subtag` and `Tag` objects or an empty array if no results were found.\n\nNote that `Tag` objects in the results represent 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' tags. These are excluded by default. Set the `all` parameter to `true` to include them.\n\nSearch is case-insensitive if `description` is a string.\n\n### tags.languages(macrolanguage) ###\n\nReturns an array of `Subtag` objects representing all the 'language' type subtags belonging to the given 'macrolanguage' type subtag.\n\nThrows an error if `macrolanguage` is not a macrolanguage.\n\n```\n> tags.languages('zh');\n[Subtag, Subtag...]\n> tags.languages('en');\nError: 'en' is not a valid macrolanguage.\n```\n\n### tags.language(subtag) ###\n\nConvenience method to get a single 'language' type subtag. Can be used to validate an input value as a language subtag. Returns a `Subtag` object or `null`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('en');\nSubtag\n> tags.language('us');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.region(subtag) ###\n\nAs above, but with 'region' type subtags.\n\n```\n> tags.region('mt');\nSubtag\n> tags.region('en');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.type(subtag, type) ###\n\nGet a subtag by type. Returns the subtag matching `type` as a `Subtag` object otherwise returns `null`.\n\nA `type` consists of one of the following strings: 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'. To get a 'grandfathered' or 'redundant' type tag use `tags(tag)`.\n\n```\n> tags.type('zh', 'macrolanguage');\nSubtag\n> tags.type('zh', 'script');\nnull\n```\n\n### tags.date() ###\n\nReturns the file date for the underlying data, as a string.\n\n```\n> tags.date();\n'2004-06-28'\n```\n\n### Subtag ###\n\n#### subtag.type() ####\n\nGet the subtag type (either 'language', 'extlang', 'script', 'region' or 'variant'). See [RFC 5646 section 2.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2) for type definitions.\n\n#### subtag.descriptions() ####\n\nReturns an array of description strings (a subtag may have more than one description).\n\n```\n> tags.language('ro').descriptions();\n['Romanian', 'Moldavian', 'Moldovan']\n```\n\n#### subtag.preferred() ####\n\nReturns a preferred subtag as a `Subtag` object if the subtag is deprecated. For example, `ro` is preferred over deprecated `mo`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('mo').preferred();\nSubtag\n```\n\n#### subtag.script() ####\n\nFor subtags of type 'language' or 'extlang', returns a `Subtag` object representing the language's default script. See [RFC 5646 section 3.1.9](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-3.1.9) for a definition of 'Suppress-Script'.\n\n#### subtag.scope() ####\n\nReturns the subtag scope as a string, or `null` if the subtag has no scope.\n\nTip: if the subtag represents a macrolanguage, you can use `tags.languages(macrolanguage)` to get a list of all the macrolanguage's individual languages.\n\n```\n> tags.language('zh').scope();\n'macrolanguage'\n> tags.language('nah').scope();\n'collection'\n```\n\n#### subtag.deprecated() ####\n\nReturns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the subtag is deprecated, otherwise returns `null`.\n\n```\n> tags.language('ja').deprecated();\n'2008-11-22'\n```\n\n#### subtag.added() ####\n\nReturns a date string reflecting the date the subtag was added to the registry.\n\n```\n> tags.language('ja').added();\n'2005-10-16'\n```\n\n#### subtag.comments() ####\n\nReturns an array of comments, if any, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n```\n> tags.language('nmf').comments();\n['see ntx']\n```\n\n#### subtag.format() ####\n\nReturn the subtag code formatted according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\n\n- language codes are made lowercase ('mn' for Mongolian)\n- script codes are made lowercase with the initial letter capitalized ('Cyrl' for Cyrillic)\n- country codes are capitalized ('MN' for Mongolia)\n\n### Tag ###\n\n#### tag.preferred() ####\n\nIf the tag is listed as 'deprecated' or 'redundant' it might have a preferred value. This method returns a `Tag` object if so.\n\n```\n> tags('zh-cmn-Hant').preferred();\nTag\n```\n\n#### tag.type() ####\n\nReturns `grandfathered` if the tag is grandfathered, `redundant` if the tag is redundant, and `tag` if neither. For a definition of grandfathered and redundant tags, see [RFC 5646 section 2.2.8](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.2.8).\n\n#### tag.subtags() ####\n\nReturns an array of subtags making up the tag, as `Subtag` objects.\n\n#### tag.language(), tag.region(), tag.script() ####\n\nShortcuts for `tag.find('language')`, `tag.find('region')` and `tag.find('script')`.\n\n#### tag.find(type) ####\n\nFind a subtag of the given type from those making up the tag.\n\n#### tag.valid() ####\n\nReturns `true` if the tag is valid, `false` otherwise.\n\n#### tag.errors() ####\n\nReturns an array of `Error` objects if the tag is invalid. The `message` property of each is readable and helpful enough for UI output. The `code` property can be checked against the `Tag.ERR_*` constants. Each error will also have either a `subtag` or `tag` property with the code of the offending tag.\n\n#### tag.format() ####\n\nFormat a tag according to the case conventions defined in [RFC 5646 section 2.1.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646#section-2.1.1).\n\n```\n> tags('en-gb').format();\n'en-GB'\n```\n\n#### tag.deprecated() ####\n\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the deprecation date if the tag is deprecated.\n\n```\n> tags('zh-cmn-Hant').deprecated();\n'2009-07-29'\n```\n\n#### tag.added() ####\n\nFor grandfathered or redundant tags, returns a date string reflecting the date the tag was added to the registry.\n\n#### tag.descriptions() ####\n\nReturns an array of tag descriptions for grandfathered or redundant tags, otherwise returns an empty array.\n\n## Resources ##\n\n- [Python version by the Flanders Heritage Agency](https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed/language-tags)\n- [Language Subtag Lookup tool by Richard Ishida](http://rishida.net/utils/subtags/)\n- [W3C Internationalization Checker](http://validator.w3.org/i18n-checker/)\n- [RFC 5646](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646)\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, [Matthew Caruana Galizia](http://twitter.com/mcaruanagalizia).\n\nThe software part of this project is licensed under an [MIT licence](http://mattcg.mit-license.org/).\n\nComments, feedback and suggestions are welcome.

May be absolute or relative.\n\n### [, opts]\nA map of options.  Here are the currently supported options:\n\n* `async` - A boolean value used for `script.async`.  By default this is `true`.\n* `attrs` - A map of attributes to set on the `script` node before appending it to the DOM.  By default this is empty.\n* `charset` - A string value used for `script.charset`.  By default this is `utf8`.\n* `text` - A string of text to append to the `script` node before it is appended to the DOM.  By default this is empty.\n* `type` - A string used for `script.type`.  By default this is `text/javascript`.\n\n### [, cb]\nA callback function of the following interface: `function(err, script) {}` where `err` is an error if any occurred and `script` is the `script` node that was appended to the DOM.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar load = require('load-script')\n\nload('foo.js', function (err, script) {\n  if (err) {\n    // print useful message\n  }\n  else {\n    console.log(script.src);// Prints 'foo'.js'\n    // use script\n    // note that in IE8 and below loading error wouldn't be reported\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3.

The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Since `process.allowedNodeEnvironmentFlags` is based on [`NODE_OPTIONS`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_node_options_options) (introduced in v8.0.0), the set of supported flags for versions older than v8.0.0 is *highly theoretical*.\n- Version ranges are matched using [semver](https://npm.im/semver).\n- This module is granular to the *minor* Node.js version number; *patch* version numbers are not considered.\n- Results for unmaintained (odd) versions of Node.js are based on data for the most recent LTS version; e.g., running this module against Node.js v7.10.0 will yield the same results as would v6.14.0.\n- Prior art: @ljharb's [util.promisify](https://npm.im/util.promisify)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n[@boneskull](https://github.com/boneskull)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2018 Christopher Hiller.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

    "copyright": "Copyright 2011 ottypes library contributors",
    "licenseText": "# JSON0 OT Type\n\nThe JSON OT type can be used to edit arbitrary JSON documents.\n\n## Features\n\nThe JSON OT type supports the following operations:\n\n- Insert/delete/move/replace items in a list, shuffling adjacent list items as needed\n- Object insert/delete/replace\n- Atomic numerical add operation\n- Embed arbitrary subtypes\n- Embedded string editing, using the old text0 OT type as a subtype\n\nJSON0 is an *invertable* type - which is to say, all operations have an inverse\noperation which will undo the original op. As such, all operations which delete\ncontent add the content to be deleted inline in the operation.\n\nBut its not perfect - here's a list of things it *cannot* do:\n\n- Object-move\n- Set if null (object insert with first writer wins semantics)\n- Efficient list insert-of-many-items\n\nIt also has O(a * b) complexity when transforming large operations by one\nanother (as opposed to O(a + b) which better algorithms can manage).\n\n\n## Operations\n\nJSON operations are lists of operation components. The operation is a grouping\nof these components, applied in order.\n\nEach operation component is an object with a `p:PATH` component. The path is a\nlist of keys to reach the target element in the document. For example, given\nthe following document:\n\n```\n{'a':[100, 200, 300], 'b': 'hi'}\n```\n\nAn operation to delete the first array element (`100`) would be the following:\n\n```\n[{p:['a', 0], ld:100}]\n```\n\nThe path (`['a', 0]`) describes how to reach the target element from the root.\nThe first element is a key in the containing object and the second is an index\ninto the array.\n\n### Summary of operations\n\n op                                    | Description\n---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------\n`{p:[path], na:x}`                     | adds `x` to the number at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path,idx], li:obj}`               | inserts the object `obj` before the item at `idx` in the list at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path,idx], ld:obj}`               | deletes the object `obj` from the index `idx` in the list at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path,idx], ld:before, li:after}`  | replaces the object `before` at the index `idx` in the list at `[path]` with the object `after`.\n`{p:[path,idx1], lm:idx2}`             | moves the object at `idx1` such that the object will be at index `idx2` in the list at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path,key], oi:obj}`               | inserts the object `obj` into the object at `[path]` with key `key`.\n`{p:[path,key], od:obj}`               | deletes the object `obj` with key `key` from the object at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path,key], od:before, oi:after}`  | replaces the object `before` with the object `after` at key `key` in the object at `[path]`.\n`{p:[path], t:subtype, o:subtypeOp}`   | applies the subtype op `o` of type `t` to the object at `[path]`\n`{p:[path,offset], si:s}`              | inserts the string `s` at offset `offset` into the string at `[path]` (uses subtypes internally).\n`{p:[path,offset], sd:s}`              | deletes the string `s` at offset `offset` from the string at `[path]` (uses subtypes internally).\n\n---\n\n### Number operations\n\nThe only operation you can perform on a number is to add to it. Remember, you\ncan always replace the number with another number by operating on the number's\ncontainer.\n\n> Are there any other ways the format should support modifying numbers? Ideas:\n>\n> - Linear multiple as well (Ie, `x = Bx + C`)\n> - MAX, MIN, etc? That would let you do timestamps...\n>\n> I can't think of any good use cases for those operations...\n\n#### Add\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, na:X}\n\nAdds X to the number at PATH. If you want to subtract, add a negative number.\n\n---\n\n### Lists and Objects\n\nLists and objects have the same set of operations (*Insert*, *Delete*,\n*Replace*, *Move*) but their semantics are very different. List operations\nshuffle adjacent list items left or right to make space (or to remove space).\nObject operations do not. You should pick the data structure which will give\nyou the behaviour you want when you design your data model. \n\nTo make it clear what the semantics of operations will be, list operations and\nobject operations are named differently. (`li`, `ld`, `lm` for lists and `oi`,\n`od` and `om` for objects).\n\n#### Inserting, Deleting and Replacing in a list\n\nUsage:\n\n- **Insert**: `{p:PATH, li:NEWVALUE}`\n- **Delete**: `{p:PATH, ld:OLDVALUE}`\n- **Replace**: `{p:PATH, ld:OLDVALUE, li:NEWVALUE}`\n\nInserts, deletes, or replaces the element at `PATH`.\n\nThe last element in the path specifies an index in the list where elements will\nbe deleted, inserted or replaced. The index must be valid (0 <= *new index* <=\n*list length*). The indexes of existing list elements may change when new\nlist elements are added or removed.\n\nThe replace operation:\n\n    {p:PATH, ld:OLDVALUE, li:NEWVALUE}\n\nis equivalent to a delete followed by an insert:\n\n    {p:PATH, ld:OLDVALUE}\n    {p:PATH, li:NEWVALUE}\n\nGiven the following list:\n\n    [100, 300, 400]\n\napplying the following operation:\n\n    [{p:[1], li:{'yo':'hi there'}}, {p:[3], ld:400}]\n\nwould result in the following new list:\n\n    [100, {'yo':'hi there'}, 300]\n\n\n#### Moving list elements\n\nYou can move list items by deleting them and & inserting them back elsewhere,\nbut if you do that concurrent operations on the deleted element will be lost.\nTo fix this, the JSON OT type has a special list move operation.\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, lm:NEWINDEX}\n\nMoves the list element specified by `PATH` to a different place in the list,\nwith index `NEWINDEX`. Any elements between the old index and the new index\nwill get new indicies, as appropriate.\n\nThe new index must be 0 <= _index_ < _list length_. The new index will be\ninterpreted __after__ the element has been removed from its current position.\nGiven the following data:\n\n    ['a', 'b', 'c']\n\nthe following operation:\n\n    [{p:[1], lm:2}]\n\nwill result in the following data:\n\n    ['a', 'c', 'b']\n\n\n#### Inserting, Deleting and Replacing in an object\n\nUsage:\n\n- **Insert**: `{p:PATH, oi:NEWVALUE}`\n- **Delete**: `{p:PATH, od:OLDVALUE}`\n- **Replace**: `{p:PATH, od:OLDVALUE, oi:NEWVALUE}`\n\nSet the element indicated by `PATH` from `OLDVALUE` to `NEWVALUE`. The last\nelement of the path must be the key of the element to be inserted, deleted or\nreplaced.\n\nWhen inserting, the key must not already be used. When deleting or replacing a\nvalue, `OLDVALUE` must be equal to the current value the object has at the\nspecified key.\n\nAs with lists, the replace operation:\n\n    {p:PATH, od:OLDVALUE, oi:NEWVALUE}\n\nis equivalent to a delete followed by an insert:\n\n    {p:PATH, od:OLDVALUE}\n    {p:PATH, oi:NEWVALUE}\n\nThere is (unfortunately) no equivalent for list move with objects.\n\n\n---\n\n### Subtype operations\n\nUsage:\n  \n    {p:PATH, t:SUBTYPE, o:OPERATION}\n    \n`PATH` is the path to the object that will be modified by the subtype.\n`SUBTYPE` is the name of the subtype, e.g. `\"text0\"`.\n`OPERATION` is the subtype operation itself.\n\nTo register a subtype, call `json0.registerSubtype` with another OT type.\nSpecifically, a subtype is a JavaScript object with the following methods:\n\n* `apply`\n* `transform`\n* `compose`\n* `invert`\n\nSee the [OT types documentation](https://github.com/ottypes/docs) for details on these methods.\n\n#### Text subtype\n\nThe old string operations are still supported (see below) but are now implemented internally as a subtype\nusing the `text0` type. You can either continue to use the original `si` and `sd` ops documented below,\nor use the `text0` type as a subtype yourself.\n\nTo edit a string, create a `text0` subtype op. For example, given the\nfollowing object:\n\n    {'key':[100,'abcde']}\n\nIf you wanted to delete the `'d'` from the string `'abcde'`, you would use the following operation:\n\n    [{p:['key',1], t: 'text0', o:[{p:3, d:'d'}]}\n\nNote the path. The components, in order, are the key to the list, and the index to\nthe `'abcde'` string. The offset to the `'d'` character in the string is given in\nthe subtype operation.\n\n##### Insert into a string\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, t:'text0', o:[{p:OFFSET, i:TEXT}]}\n    \nInsert `TEXT` to the string specified by `PATH` at the position specified by `OFFSET`.\n\n##### Delete from a string\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, t:'text0', o:[{p:OFFSET, d:TEXT}]}\n    \nDelete `TEXT` in the string specified by `PATH` at the position specified by `OFFSET`.\n\n---\n\n### String operations\n\nThese operations are now internally implemented as subtype operations using the `text0` type, but you can still use them if you like. See above.\n\nIf the content at a path is a string, an operation can edit the string\nin-place, either deleting characters or inserting characters.\n\nTo edit a string, add the string offset to the path. For example, given the\nfollowing object:\n\n    {'key':[100,'abcde']}\n\nIf you wanted to delete the `'d'` from the string `'abcde'`, you would use the following operation:\n\n    [{p:['key',1,3],sd:'d'}]\n\nNote the path. The components, in order, are the key to the list, the index to\nthe `'abcde'` string, and then the offset to the `'d'` character in the string.\n\n#### Insert into a string\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, si:TEXT}\n\nInsert `TEXT` at the location specified by `PATH`. The path must specify an\noffset in a string.\n\n#### Delete from a string\n\nUsage:\n\n    {p:PATH, sd:TEXT}\n\nDelete `TEXT` at the location specified by `PATH`. The path must specify an\noffset in a string. `TEXT` must be contained at the location specified.\n\n---\n\n# Commentary\n\nThis library was written a couple of years ago by [Jeremy Apthorp](https://github.com/nornagon). It was\noriginally written in coffeescript as part of ShareJS, and then it got pulled\nout into the share/ottypes library and its finally landed here.\n\nThe type uses the list-of-op-components model, where each operation makes a\nseries of individual changes to a document. Joseph now thinks this is a\nterrible idea because it doesn't scale well to large operations - it has\n(N<sup>2</sup> instead of 2N complexity).\n\nJeremy and Joseph have talked about rewriting this library to instead make each\noperation be a sparse traversal of the document. But it was obnoxiously\ndifficult to implement JSON OT correctly in the first place - it'll probably\ntake both of us thinking about nothing else for a few weeks to make that\nhappen.\n\nWhen it was written, the embedded text0 type was sharejs's text type. Its since\nbeen rewritten to make each operation be a traversal, but the JSON OT type\nstill embeds the old type. As such, that old text type is included in this\nrepository. If you want to use text0 in your own project, I'd be very happy to\npull it out of here and make it its own module. However, I recommend that you\njust use the new text type. Its simpler and faster.\n\n---\n\n# License\n\nAll code contributed to this repository is licensed under the standard MIT license:\n\nCopyright 2011 ottypes library contributors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following condition:\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.\n\nIn case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [{\n      test: /\\.js$/,\n      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),\n    }]\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# Iterate\n\nThis JavaScript package exports an iterator operator that accepts arrays and any\nobject that implements iterate.\n\n```\n$ npm install --save pop-iterate\n```\n\nThe iterate operator accepts an array, or object that implements iterate, and\nreturns an iterator, as described by the [iterator protocol][Iterator], with\nsome extensions.\nThe iterations have an index property with the index corresponding to the value.\n\n[Iterator]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/The_Iterator_protocol\n\n```js\nvar iterator = iterate([1, 2, 3]);\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 1, done: false, index: 0});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 2, done: false, index: 1});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 3, done: false, index: 2});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({done: true});\n```\n\nIterating on an array, the iterate method accepts optional start, stop, and step\narguments.\n\n```js\nvar array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];\nvar iterator = iterate(array, 1, 6, 2);\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 2, done: false, index: 1});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 4, done: false, index: 3});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 6, done: false, index: 5});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({done: true});\n```\n\nThe iterate operator also iterates the owned properties of an object.\n\n```js\nvar object = {a: 10, b: 20, c: 30};\nvar iterator = iterate(object);\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 10, done: false, index: \"a\"});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 20, done: false, index: \"b\"});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({value: 30, done: false, index: \"c\"});\nexpect(iterator.next()).toEqual({done: true});\n```\n\n## Polymorphic operator\n\nA well-planned system of objects is beautiful: a system where every meaningful\nmethod for an object has been anticipated in the design.\nInevitably, another layer of architecture introduces a new concept and with it\nthe temptation to monkey-patch, dunk-punch, or otherwise cover-up the omission.\nBut reaching backward in time, up through the layers of architecture doesn't\nalways compose well, when different levels introduce concepts of the same name\nbut distinct behavior.\n\nA polymorphic operator is a function that accepts as its first argument an\nobject and varies its behavior depending on its type.\nSuch an operator has the benefit of covering for the types from higher layers of\narchitecture, but defers to the eponymous method name of types yet to be\ndefined.\n\nThe iterate operator works for arrays and objects.\nAny other object can be iterable by implementing the `iterate` method, and the\niterate operator will defer to it.\n\n```js\nfunction Collection() {}\nCollection.prototype.iterate = function (start, stop, step) {\n};\n```\n\nThis package also exports the individual parts form which it makes iterators.\n\n```js\nvar Iteration = require(\"pop-iterate/iteration\");\nvar ArrayIterator = require(\"pop-iterate/array-iterator\");\nvar ObjectIterator = require(\"pop-iterate/object-iterator\");\n```",

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->\n\n## Wut? Poppers?\n\nA popper is an element on the screen which \"pops out\" from the natural flow of your application.  \nCommon examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.\n\n\n## So, yet another tooltip library?\n\nWell, basically, **no**.  \nPopper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element\nto make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  \n\nThe engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**\n(similar to middlewares or plugins).  \nThe whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).\n\nPopper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  \nIt's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).\n\n### Popper.js\n\nThis is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to\nthe poppers.\n\nSome of the key points are:\n\n- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);\n- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;\n- Supports Shadow DOM elements;\n- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;\n\nVisit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).\n\n\n### Tooltip.js\n\nSince lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,\nwe created **Tooltip.js**.  \nIt's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  \nIts API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be\neasy to integrate it in your projects.  \nThe tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).\n\n\n## Installation\nPopper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |\n| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |\n| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |\n| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\nTooltip.js as well:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |\n| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |\n| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\n\\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  \nFor more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).\n\n### Dist targets\n\nPopper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.\n\n- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;\n- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;\n- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;\n\nMake sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button\n\n```js\nvar reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nvar popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nvar anotherPopper = new Popper(\n    reference,\n    popper,\n    {\n        // popper options here\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### Callbacks\n\nPopper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after\nthe popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.\n\n```js\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    onCreate: (data) => {\n        // data is an object containing all the informations computed\n        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow\n        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation\n    },\n    onUpdate: (data) => {\n        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Writing your own modifiers\n\nPopper.js is based on a \"plugin-like\" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated \"modifiers\".  \nA modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  \n\nTo learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)\n\n\n### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration\n\nIntegrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because\nthey usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  \nPopper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,\nyou can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using\nyour library of choice.  \n\nFor a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing\nframeworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.\n\nAlternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and\nintegrate Popper.js by yourself!\n\n```js\nfunction applyReactStyle(data) {\n    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper\n};\n\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    modifiers: {\n        applyStyle: { enabled: false },\n        applyReactStyle: {\n            enabled: true,\n            fn: applyReactStyle,\n            order: 800,\n        },\n    },\n});\n\n```\n\n### Migration from Popper.js v0\n\nSince the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to\nPopper.js v1.  \n\nhttps://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62\n\nFeel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.\n\n### Performances\n\nPopper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  \nThis means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Libraries using Popper.js\n\nThe aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to\nbe used in 3rd party libraries.  \n\nVisit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.\n\n\n### Credits\nI want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:\n\n- [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development;\n- [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library;\n- [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library;\n- [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world;\n- [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports;\n- **you** for the star you'll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try 🙂\n\n### Copyright and license\nCode and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2.

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

    "licenseText": "# CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n## Statement of Purpose\n\nThe laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer\nexclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and\nsubsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of\nauthorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).\n\nCertain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the\npurpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works\n(“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of\ninfringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and\nredistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,\nincluding without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

So the previous examples would\nboth produce the same stack trace.**\n\nAll arguments after the message will be used to format the actual error\nmessage that will be thrown.\n\nThe following precondition checks are provded:\n\n- checkArgument(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n- checkState(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n- checkIsDef(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsDefAndNotNull(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsString(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsArray(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsNumber(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsBoolean(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsFunction(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n- checkIsObject(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]]) -> value\n\n## API\n\n### Static functions\n\n#### precond.checkArgument(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be truthy\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is true. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if value\nis false.\n\n#### precond.checkState(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be truthy\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is true. Throws an `IllegalStateError` if value\nis false.\n\n#### precond.checkIsDef(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be defined\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is defined (could be null). Throws an\n`IllegalArgumentError` if value is undefined. Returns the value of\nthe value that was validated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsDefAndNotNull(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be defined and not null\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is defined and not null. Throws an\n`IllegalArgumentError` if value is undefined or null. Returns the value of\nthe value that was validated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsString(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be a string\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is a string or a String object. Throws an\n`IllegalArgumentError` if value isn't a string. Returns the value of\nthe value that was validated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsArray(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be an array\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is an array. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if\nvalue isn't an array. Returns the value of the value that was\nvalidated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsNumber(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be a number\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is a number. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if\nvalue isn't a number. Returns the value of the value that was\nvalidated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsBoolean(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be a boolean\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is a boolean. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if\nvalue isn't a boolean. Returns the value of the value that was\nvalidated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsFunction(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be a function\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is a function. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if\nvalue isn't a function. Returns the value of the value that was\nvalidated.\n\n#### precond.checkIsObject(value, [messageFormat, [formatArgs, ...]])\n\n- value: the value that is required to be an object\n- messageFormat: error message format template\n- formatArgs: arguments to be substituted into the message template\n\nEnsures that value is an object. Throws an `IllegalArgumentError` if\nvalue isn't an object. Returns the value of the value that was\nvalidated.\n\n### Class precond.IllegalArgumentError\n\nExtends `Error` and is thrown to signal illegal arguments.\n\n### Class precond.IllegalStateError\n\nExtends `Error` and is thrown to signal that the program or object has reached\nan illegal state.\n\n## License\n\nThis code is free to use under the terms of the [MIT license](http://mturcotte.mit-license.org/).",

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

**unified** for API docs »][unified]\n\n### `processor().use(parse[, options])`\n\nConfigure the `processor` to read Markdown as input and process\n[**mdast**][mdast] syntax trees.\n\n##### `options`\n\nOptions can be passed directly, or passed later through\n[`processor.data()`][data].\n\n###### `options.gfm`\n\nGFM mode (`boolean`, default: `true`).\n\n```markdown\nhello ~~hi~~ world\n```\n\nTurns on:\n\n*   [Fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks#fenced-code-blocks)\n*   [Autolinking of URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls)\n*   [Deletions (strikethrough)](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#styling-text)\n*   [Task lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#task-lists)\n*   [Tables](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables)\n\n###### `options.commonmark`\n\nCommonMark mode (`boolean`, default: `false`).\n\n```markdown\nThis is a paragraph\n    and this is also part of the preceding paragraph.\n```\n\nAllows:\n\n*   Empty lines to split block quotes\n*   Parentheses (`(` and `)`) around link and image titles\n*   Any escaped [ASCII punctuation][escapes] character\n*   Closing parenthesis (`)`) as an ordered list marker\n*   URL definitions in block quotes\n\nDisallows:\n\n*   Indented code blocks directly following a paragraph\n*   ATX headings (`# Hash headings`) without spacing after opening hashes or and\n    before closing hashes\n*   Setext headings (`Underline headings\\n---`) when following a paragraph\n*   Newlines in link and image titles\n*   White space in link and image URLs in auto-links (links in brackets, `<` and\n    `>`)\n*   Lazy block quote continuation, lines not preceded by a greater than\n    character (`>`), for lists, code, and thematic breaks\n\n###### `options.pedantic`\n\n⚠️ Pedantic was previously used to mimic old-style Markdown mode: no tables, no\nfenced code, and with many bugs.\nIt’s currently still “working”, but please do not use it, it’ll be removed in\nthe future.\n\n###### `options.blocks`\n\nBlocks (`Array.<string>`, default: list of [block HTML elements][blocks]).\n\n```markdown\n<block>foo\n</block>\n```\n\nDefines which HTML elements are seen as block level.\n\n### `parse.Parser`\n\nAccess to the [parser][], if you need it.\n\n## Extending the `Parser`\n\nTypically, using [*transformers*][transformer] to manipulate a syntax tree\nproduces the desired output.\nSometimes, such as when introducing new syntactic entities with a certain\nprecedence, interfacing with the parser is necessary.\n\nIf the `remark-parse` plugin is used, it adds a [`Parser`][parser] constructor\nfunction to the `processor`.\nOther plugins can add tokenizers to its prototype to change how Markdown is\nparsed.\n\nThe below plugin adds a [tokenizer][] for at-mentions.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = mentions\n\nfunction mentions() {\n  var Parser = this.Parser\n  var tokenizers = Parser.prototype.inlineTokenizers\n  var methods = Parser.prototype.inlineMethods\n\n  // Add an inline tokenizer (defined in the following example).\n  tokenizers.mention = tokenizeMention\n\n  // Run it just before `text`.\n  methods.splice(methods.indexOf('text'), 0, 'mention')\n}\n```\n\n### `Parser#blockTokenizers`\n\nMap of names to [tokenizer][]s (`Object.<Function>`).\nThese tokenizers (such as `fencedCode`, `table`, and `paragraph`) eat from the\nstart of a value to a line ending.\n\nSee `#blockMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by default.\n\n### `Parser#blockMethods`\n\nList of `blockTokenizers` names (`Array.<string>`).\nSpecifies the order in which tokenizers run.\n\nPrecedence of default block methods is as follows:\n\n<!--methods-block start-->\n\n*   `blankLine`\n*   `indentedCode`\n*   `fencedCode`\n*   `blockquote`\n*   `atxHeading`\n*   `thematicBreak`\n*   `list`\n*   `setextHeading`\n*   `html`\n*   `definition`\n*   `table`\n*   `paragraph`\n\n<!--methods-block end-->\n\n### `Parser#inlineTokenizers`\n\nMap of names to [tokenizer][]s (`Object.<Function>`).\nThese tokenizers (such as `url`, `reference`, and `emphasis`) eat from the start\nof a value.\nTo increase performance, they depend on [locator][]s.\n\nSee `#inlineMethods` below for a list of methods that are included by default.\n\n### `Parser#inlineMethods`\n\nList of `inlineTokenizers` names (`Array.<string>`).\nSpecifies the order in which tokenizers run.\n\nPrecedence of default inline methods is as follows:\n\n<!--methods-inline start-->\n\n*   `escape`\n*   `autoLink`\n*   `url`\n*   `email`\n*   `html`\n*   `link`\n*   `reference`\n*   `strong`\n*   `emphasis`\n*   `deletion`\n*   `code`\n*   `break`\n*   `text`\n\n<!--methods-inline end-->\n\n### `function tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\nThere are two types of tokenizers: block level and inline level.\nBoth are functions, and work the same, but inline tokenizers must have a\n[locator][].\n\nThe following example shows an inline tokenizer that is added by the mentions\nplugin above.\n\n```js\ntokenizeMention.notInLink = true\ntokenizeMention.locator = locateMention\n\nfunction tokenizeMention(eat, value, silent) {\n  var match = /^@(\\w+)/.exec(value)\n\n  if (match) {\n    if (silent) {\n      return true\n    }\n\n    return eat(match[0])({\n      type: 'link',\n      url: 'https://social-network/' + match[1],\n      children: [{type: 'text', value: match[0]}]\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTokenizers *test* whether a document starts with a certain syntactic entity.\nIn *silent* mode, they return whether that test passes.\nIn *normal* mode, they consume that token, a process which is called “eating”.\n\nLocators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by providing where the next\nentity may occur.\n\n###### Signatures\n\n*   `Node? = tokenizer(eat, value)`\n*   `boolean? = tokenizer(eat, value, silent)`\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `eat` ([`Function`][eat]) — Eat, when applicable, an entity\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may start an entity\n*   `silent` (`boolean`, optional) — Whether to detect or consume\n\n###### Properties\n\n*   `locator` ([`Function`][locator]) — Required for inline tokenizers\n*   `onlyAtStart` (`boolean`) — Whether nodes can only be found at the beginning\n    of the document\n*   `notInBlock` (`boolean`) — Whether nodes cannot be in block quotes or lists\n*   `notInList` (`boolean`) — Whether nodes cannot be in lists\n*   `notInLink` (`boolean`) — Whether nodes cannot be in links\n\n###### Returns\n\n*   `boolean?`, in *silent* mode — whether a node can be found at the start of\n    `value`\n*   [`Node?`][node], In *normal* mode — If it can be found at the start of\n    `value`\n\n### `tokenizer.locator(value, fromIndex)`\n\nLocators are required for inline tokenizers.\nTheir role is to keep parsing performant.\n\nThe following example shows a locator that is added by the mentions tokenizer\nabove.\n\n```js\nfunction locateMention(value, fromIndex) {\n  return value.indexOf('@', fromIndex)\n}\n```\n\nLocators enable inline tokenizers to function faster by providing information on\nwhere the next entity *may* occur.\nLocators may be wrong, it’s OK if there actually isn’t a node to be found at the\nindex they return.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `value` (`string`) — Value which may contain an entity\n*   `fromIndex` (`number`) — Position to start searching at\n\n###### Returns\n\n`number` — Index at which an entity may start, and `-1` otherwise.\n\n### `eat(subvalue)`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n```\n\nEat `subvalue`, which is a string at the start of the [tokenized][tokenizer]\n`value`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `subvalue` (`string`) - Value to eat\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`add`][add].\n\n### `add(node[, parent])`\n\n```js\nvar add = eat('foo')\n\nadd({type: 'text', value: 'foo'})\n```\n\nAdd [positional information][position] to `node` and add `node` to `parent`.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and to add\n*   `parent` ([`Parent`][parent], optional) - Place to add `node` to in the\n    syntax tree.\n    Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`Node`][node] — The given `node`.\n\n### `add.test()`\n\nGet the [positional information][position] that would be patched on `node` by\n`add`.\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`Position`][position].\n\n### `add.reset(node[, parent])`\n\n`add`, but resets the internal position.\nUseful for example in lists, where the same content is first eaten for a list,\nand later for list items.\n\n###### Parameters\n\n*   `node` ([`Node`][node]) - Node to patch position on and insert\n*   `parent` ([`Node`][node], optional) - Place to add `node` to in\n    the syntax tree.\n    Defaults to the currently processed node\n\n###### Returns\n\n[`Node`][node] — The given node.\n\n### Turning off a tokenizer\n\nIn some situations, you may want to turn off a tokenizer to avoid parsing that\nsyntactic feature.\n\nPreferably, use the [`remark-disable-tokenizers`][remark-disable-tokenizers]\nplugin to turn off tokenizers.\n\nAlternatively, this can be done by replacing the tokenizer from\n`blockTokenizers` (or `blockMethods`) or `inlineTokenizers` (or\n`inlineMethods`).\n\nThe following example turns off indented code blocks:\n\n```js\nremarkParse.Parser.prototype.blockTokenizers.indentedCode = indentedCode\n\nfunction indentedCode() {\n  return true\n}\n```\n\n## Security\n\nAs Markdown is sometimes used for HTML, and improper use of HTML can open you up\nto a [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of remark can also be unsafe.\nWhen going to HTML, use remark in combination with the [**rehype**][rehype]\necosystem, and use [`rehype-sanitize`][sanitize] to make the tree safe.\n\nUse of remark plugins could also open you up to other attacks.\nCarefully assess each plugin and the risks involved in using them.\n\n## Contribute\n\nSee [`contributing.md`][contributing] in [`remarkjs/.github`][health] for ways\nto get started.\nSee [`support.md`][support] for ways to get help.\nIdeas for new plugins and tools can be posted in [`remarkjs/ideas`][ideas].\n\nA curated list of awesome remark resources can be found in [**awesome\nremark**][awesome].\n\nThis project has a [code of conduct][coc].\nBy interacting with this repository, organization, or community you agree to\nabide by its terms.\n\n##

The `options` are\npassed directly to `css.stringify`.\n\nUnlike `css.stringify`, if you pass `sourcemap: true` a string will still be\nreturned, with the source map inlined. Also use `sourcemapAsObject: true` if\nyou want the `css.stringify` return value.\n\n## Plugins\n\nRework has a rich collection of plugins and mixins.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# rollup-pluginutils\n\nA set of functions commonly used by Rollup plugins.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save rollup-pluginutils\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### addExtension\n\n```js\nimport { addExtension } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\n\nexport default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {\n  return {\n    resolveId ( code, id ) {\n      // only adds an extension if there isn't one already\n      id = addExtension( id ); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js -> foo.js`\n      id = addExtension( id, '.myext' ); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js -> `foo.js`\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n\n### attachScopes\n\nThis function attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.\n\nSee [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.\n\n```js\nimport { attachScopes } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\nimport { walk } from 'estree-walker';\n\nexport default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {\n  return {\n    transform ( code ) {\n      const ast = this.parse( code );\n\n      let scope = attachScopes( ast, 'scope' );\n\n      walk( ast, {\n        enter ( node ) {\n          if ( node.scope ) scope = node.scope;\n\n          if ( !scope.contains( 'foo' ) ) {\n            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,\n            // we assume it's a global\n          }\n        },\n        leave ( node ) {\n          if ( node.scope ) scope = scope.parent;\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n\n### createFilter\n\n```js\nimport { createFilter } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\n\nexport default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {\n  // `options.include` and `options.exclude` can each be a minimatch\n  // pattern, or an array of minimatch patterns, relative to process.cwd()\n  var filter = createFilter( options.include, options.exclude );\n\n  return {\n    transform ( code, id ) {\n      // if `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter\n      // will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match\n      // one or more of the minimatch patterns, and must not match\n      // any of the `options.exclude` patterns.\n      if ( !filter( id ) ) return;\n\n      // proceed with the transformation...\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to resolve the patterns against a directory other than\n`process.cwd()`, you can additionally pass a `resolve` option:\n\n```js\nvar filter = createFilter( options.include, options.exclude, {resolve: '/my/base/dir'} )\n```\n\nIf `resolve` is a string, then this value will be used as the base directory.\nRelative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `resolve` is\n`false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can\nbe useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.\n\n\n### makeLegalIdentifier\n\n```js\nimport { makeLegalIdentifier } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\n\nmakeLegalIdentifier( 'foo-bar' ); // 'foo_bar'\nmakeLegalIdentifier( 'typeof' ); // '_typeof'\n```\n\n### dataToEsm\n\nHelper for treeshakable data imports\n\n```js\nimport { dataToEsm } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\n\nconst esModuleSource = dataToEsm({\n  custom: 'data',\n  to: ['treeshake']\n}, {\n  compact: false,\n  indent: '\\t',\n  preferConst: false,\n  objectShorthand: false,\n  namedExports: true\n});\n/*\nOutputs the string ES module source:\n  export const custom = 'data';\n  export const to = ['treeshake'];\n  export default { custom, to };\n*/\n```\n\n### extractAssignedNames\n\nExtract the names of all assignment targets from patterns.\n\n```js\nimport { extractAssignedNames } from 'rollup-pluginutils';\nimport { walk } from 'estree-walker';\n\nexport default function myPlugin ( options = {} ) {\n  return {\n    transform ( code ) {\n      const ast = this.parse( code );\n\n      walk( ast, {\n        enter ( node ) {\n          if ( node.type === 'VariableDeclarator' ) {\n          \tconst declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);\n          \t// do something with the declared names\n          \t// e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ... => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  };\n}\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

It does that by:\n\n* By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive\n* Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues\n* Maintains a consistent API across different platforms\n* Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:\n  * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)\n  * [the watchexec library](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)\n  * polling\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install sane\n```\n\n## How to choose a mode\n\nDon't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane\nmaintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.\n\n* If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode\n* If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode\n* If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`\n* If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling\n* Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you\n\n## API\n\n### sane(dir, options)\n\nWatches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.\n\n```js\nvar watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});\nwatcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });\nwatcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });\nwatcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });\n// close\nwatcher.close();\n```\n\noptions:\n\n* `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n* `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.\n* `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).\n* `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.\n* `watchexec`: makes the watcher use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec).\n* `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n* `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\nFor the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).\nIf you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).\nIf you choose to use `watchexec` you'll have to [install watchexec yourself](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec)).\nFor the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).\n\n### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.Watchexec(dir, options)\n\nThe watchexec watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.\n\n### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)\n\nThe polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:\n\n* interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher#close\n\nStops watching.\n\n### sane.{Node|Watchman|Watchexec|Poll}Watcher events\n\nEmits the following events:\n\nAll events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory\n* `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory\n* `change` when a file changes\n* `add` when a file or directory has been added\n* `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted\n\n## CLI\n\nThis module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.\n\n```\nUsage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]\n\nOPTIONS:\n    --glob=<filePattern>\n      A single string glob pattern or an array of them.\n\n    --ignored=<filePattern>\n      A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.\n\n    --poll, -p\n      Use polling mode.\n\n    --watchman, -w\n      Use watchman (if available).\n\n    --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>\n      Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).\n\n    --dot, -d\n      Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.\n\n    --wait=<seconds>\n      Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled\n      after running <command>. Setting this option will\n      throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.\n    --quiet, -q\n      Disables sane's console output\n\n    --changes-only, -o\n      Runs <command> only when a change occur. Skips running <command> at startup\n```\n\nIt will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.\n\n### CLI example usage\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' --wait=3`\n- `sane 'echo \"A command ran\"' -p`\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Credits\nThe CLI was originally based on the [watch CLI](https://github.com/mikeal/watch).

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

    "licenseText": "# saxes\n\nA sax-style non-validating parser for XML.\n\nSaxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions\nof sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4.\n\nDesigned with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the\nbrowser or other CommonJS implementations.\n\nSaxes does not support Node versions older than 10.\n\n## Notable Differences from Sax.\n\n* Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML\n  well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called \"strict mode\", is not strict. It\n  silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need\n  better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is.\n\n  Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes\n  will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to\n  extract data from malformed documents like sax does.\n\n* Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign\n  of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to\n  removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes\n  adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML\n  specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the\n  performance improvement.\n\n* Saxes does not aim to support antiquated platforms. We will not pollute the\n  source or the default build with support for antiquated platforms. If you want\n  support for IE 11, you are welcome to produce a PR that adds a *new build*\n  transpiled to ES5.\n\n* Saxes handles errors differently from sax: it provides a default onerror\n  handler which throws. You can replace it with your own handler if you want. If\n  your handler does nothing, there is no `resume` method to call.\n\n* There's no `Stream` API. A revamped API may be introduced later. (It is still\n  a \"streaming parser\" in the general sense that you write a character stream to\n  it.)\n\n* Saxes does not have facilities for limiting the size the data chunks passed to\n  event handlers. See the FAQ entry for more details.\n\n## Conformance\n\nSaxes supports:\n\n* [XML 1.0 fifth edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/)\n* [XML 1.1 second edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml11-20060816/)\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.0 (Third Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xml-names-20091208/).\n* [Namespaces in XML 1.1 (Second Edition)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names11-20060816/).\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis is a non-validating parser so it only verifies whether the document is\nwell-formed. We do aim to raise errors for all malformed constructs\nencountered. However, this parser does not thorougly parse the contents of\nDTDs. So most malformedness errors caused by errors **in DTDs** cannot be\nreported.\n\n## Regarding `<!DOCTYPE` and `<!ENTITY`\n\nThe parser will handle the basic XML entities in text nodes and attribute\nvalues: `&amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;`. It's possible to define additional\nentities in XML by putting them in the DTD. This parser doesn't do anything with\nthat. If you want to listen to the `doctype` event, and then fetch the\ndoctypes, and read the entities and add them to `parser.ENTITIES`, then be my\nguest.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe source code contains JSDOC comments. Use them. What follows is a brief\nsummary of what is available. The final authority is the source code.\n\n**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT IS PUBLIC AND WHAT IS PRIVATE.**\n\nThe move to TypeScript makes it so that everything is now formally private,\nprotected, or public.\n\nIf you use anything not public, that's at your own peril.\n\nIf there's a mistake in the documentation, raise an issue. If you just assume,\nyou may assume incorrectly.\n\n## Summary Usage Information\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\nvar saxes = require(\"./lib/saxes\"),\n  parser = new saxes.SaxesParser();\n\nparser.on(\"error\", function (e) {\n  // an error happened.\n});\nparser.on(\"text\", function (t) {\n  // got some text.  t is the string of text.\n});\nparser.on(\"opentag\", function (node) {\n  // opened a tag.  node has \"name\" and \"attributes\"\n});\nparser.on(\"end\", function () {\n  // parser stream is done, and ready to have more stuff written to it.\n});\n\nparser.write('<xml>Hello, <who name=\"world\">world</who>!</xml>').close();\n```\n\n### Constructor Arguments\n\nSettings supported:\n\n* `xmlns` - Boolean. If `true`, then namespaces are supported. Default\n  is `false`.\n\n* `position` - Boolean. If `false`, then don't track line/col/position. Unset is\n  treated as `true`. Default is unset. Currently, setting this to `false` only\n  results in a cosmetic change: the errors reported do not contain position\n  information. sax-js would literally turn off the position-computing logic if\n  this flag was set to false. The notion was that it would optimize\n  execution. In saxes at least it turns out that continually testing this flag\n  causes a cost that offsets the benefits of turning off this logic.\n\n* `fileName` - String. Set a file name for error reporting. This is useful only\n  when tracking positions. You may leave it unset.\n\n* `fragment` - Boolean. If `true`, parse the XML as an XML fragment. Default is\n  `false`.\n\n* `additionalNamespaces` - A plain object whose key, value pairs define\n   namespaces known before parsing the XML file. It is not legal to pass\n   bindings for the namespaces `\"xml\"` or `\"xmlns\"`.\n\n* `defaultXMLVersion` - The default version of the XML specification to use if\n  the document contains no XML declaration. If the document does contain an XML\n  declaration, then this setting is ignored. Must be `\"1.0\"` or `\"1.1\"`. The\n  default is `\"1.0\"`.\n\n* `forceXMLVersion` - Boolean. A flag indicating whether to force the XML\n  version used for parsing to the value of ``defaultXMLVersion``. When this flag\n  is ``true``, ``defaultXMLVersion`` must be specified. If unspecified, the\n  default value of this flag is ``false``.\n\n  Example: suppose you are parsing a document that has an XML declaration\n  specifying XML version 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` without setting\n  ``forceXMLVersion`` then the XML declaration will override the value of\n  ``defaultXMLVersion`` and the document will be parsed according to XML 1.1.\n\n  If you set ``defaultXMLVersion`` to ``\"1.0\"`` and set ``forceXMLVersion`` to\n  ``true``, then the XML declaration will be ignored and the document will be\n  parsed according to XML 1.0.\n\n### Methods\n\n`write` - Write bytes onto the stream. You don't have to pass the whole document\nin one `write` call. You can read your source chunk by chunk and call `write`\nwith each chunk.\n\n`close` - Close the stream. Once closed, no more data may be written until it is\ndone processing the buffer, which is signaled by the `end` event.\n\n### Properties\n\nThe parser has the following properties:\n\n`line`, `column`, `columnIndex`, `position` - Indications of the position in the\nXML document where the parser currently is looking. The `columnIndex` property\ncounts columns as if indexing into a JavaScript string, whereas the `column`\nproperty counts Unicode characters.\n\n`closed` - Boolean indicating whether or not the parser can be written to.  If\nit's `true`, then wait for the `ready` event to write again.\n\n`opt` - Any options passed into the constructor.\n\n`xmlDecl` - The XML declaration for this document. It contains the fields\n`version`, `encoding` and `standalone`. They are all `undefined` before\nencountering the XML declaration. If they are undefined after the XML\ndeclaration, the corresponding value was not set by the declaration. There is no\nevent associated with the XML declaration. In a well-formed document, the XML\ndeclaration may be preceded only by an optional BOM. So by the time any event\ngenerated by the parser happens, the declaration has been processed if present\nat all. Otherwise, you have a malformed document, and as stated above, you\ncannot rely on the parser data!\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe parser continues to parse even upon encountering errors, and does its best\nto continue reporting errors. You should heed all errors reported. After an\nerror, however, saxes may interpret your document incorrectly. For instance\n``<foo a=bc=\"d\"/>`` is invalid XML. Did you mean to have ``<foo a=\"bc=d\"/>`` or\n``<foo a=\"b\" c=\"d\"/>`` or some other variation?  For the sake of continuing to\nprovide errors, saxes will continue parsing the document, but the structure it\nreports may be incorrect. It is only after the errors are fixed in the document\nthat saxes can provide a reliable interpretation of the document.\n\nThat leaves you with two rules of thumb when using saxes:\n\n* Pay attention to the errors that saxes report. The default `onerror` handler\n  throws, so by default, you cannot miss errors.\n\n* **ONCE AN ERROR HAS BEEN ENCOUNTERED, STOP RELYING ON THE EVENT HANDLERS OTHER\n  THAN `onerror`.** As explained above, when saxes runs into a well-formedness\n  problem, it makes a guess in order to continue reporting more errors. The guess\n  may be wrong.\n\n### Events\n\nTo listen to an event, override `on<eventname>`. The list of supported events\nare also in the exported `EVENTS` array.\n\nSee the JSDOC comments in the source code for a description of each supported\nevent.\n\n### Parsing XML Fragments\n\nThe XML specification does not define any method by which to parse XML\nfragments. However, there are usage scenarios in which it is desirable to parse\nfragments. In order to allow this, saxes provides three initialization options.\n\nIf you pass the option `fragment: true` to the parser constructor, the parser\nwill expect an XML fragment. It essentially starts with a parsing state\nequivalent to the one it would be in if `parser.write(\"<foo\">)` had been called\nright after initialization. In other words, it expects content which is\nacceptable inside an element. This also turns off well-formedness checks that\nare inappropriate when parsing a fragment.\n\nThe option `additionalNamespaces` allows you to define additional prefix-to-URI\nbindings known before parsing starts. You would use this over `resolvePrefix` if\nyou have at the ready a series of namespaces bindings to use.\n\nThe option `resolvePrefix` allows you to pass a function which saxes will use if\nit is unable to resolve a namespace prefix by itself. You would use this over\n`additionalNamespaces` in a context where getting a complete list of defined\nnamespaces is onerous.\n\nNote that you can use `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` together if you\nwant. `additionalNamespaces` applies before `resolvePrefix`.\n\nThe options `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are really meant to be\nused for parsing fragments. However, saxes won't prevent you from using them\nwith `fragment: false`. Note that if you do this, your document may parse\nwithout errors and yet be malformed because the document can refer to namespaces\nwhich are not defined *in* the document.\n\nOf course, `additionalNamespaces` and `resolvePrefix` are used only if `xmlns`\nis `true`. If you are parsing a fragment that does not use namespaces, there's\nno point in setting these options.\n\n### Performance Tips\n\n* saxes works faster on files that use newlines (``\\u000A``) as end of line\n  markers than files that use other end of line markers (like ``\\r`` or\n  ``\\r\\n``). The XML specification requires that conformant applications behave\n  as if all characters that are to be treated as end of line characters are\n  converted to ``\\u000A`` prior to parsing. The optimal code path for saxes is a\n  file in which all end of line characters are already ``\\u000A``.\n\n* Don't split Unicode strings you feed to saxes across surrogates. When you\n  naively split a string in JavaScript, you run the risk of splitting a Unicode\n  character into two surrogates. e.g.  In the following example ``a`` and ``b``\n  each contain half of a single Unicode character: ``const a = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[0];\n  const b = \"\\u{1F4A9}\"[1]`` If you feed such split surrogates to versions of\n  saxes prior to 4, you'd get errors. Saxes version 4 and over are able to\n  detect when a chunk of data ends with a surrogate and carry over the surrogate\n  to the next chunk. However this operation entails slicing and concatenating\n  strings. If you can feed your data in a way that does not split surrogates,\n  you should do it. (Obviously, feeding all the data at once with a single write\n  is fastest.)\n\n* Don't set event handlers you don't need. Saxes has always aimed to avoid doing\n  work that will just be tossed away but future improvements hope to do this\n  more aggressively. One way saxes knows whether or not some data is needed is\n  by checking whether a handler has been set for a specific event.\n\n## FAQ\n\nQ. Why has saxes dropped support for limiting the size of data chunks passed to\nevent handlers?\n\nA. With sax you could set ``MAX_BUFFER_LENGTH`` to cause the parser to limit the\nsize of data chunks passed to event handlers. So if you ran into a span of text\nabove the limit, multiple ``text`` events with smaller data chunks were fired\ninstead of a single event with a large chunk.\n\nHowever, that functionality had some problematic characteristics. It had an\narbitrary default value. It was library-wide so all parsers created from a\nsingle instance of the ``sax`` library shared it. This could potentially cause\nconflicts among libraries running in the same VM but using sax for different\npurposes.\n\nThese issues could have been easily fixed, but there were larger issues. The\nbuffer limit arbitrarily applied to some events but not others. It would split\n``text``, ``cdata`` and ``script`` events. However, if a ``comment``,\n``doctype``, ``attribute`` or ``processing instruction`` were more than the\nlimit, the parser would generate an error and you were left picking up the\npieces.\n\nIt was not intuitive to use. You'd think setting the limit to 1K would prevent\nchunks bigger than 1K to be passed to event handlers. But that was not the\ncase. A comment in the source code told you that you might go over the limit if\nyou passed large chunks to ``write``. So if you want a 1K limit, don't pass 64K\nchunks to ``write``. Fair enough. You know what limit you want so you can\ncontrol the size of the data you pass to ``write``. So you limit the chunks to\n``write`` to 1K at a time. Even if you do this, your event handlers may get data\nchunks that are 2K in size. Suppose on the previous ``write`` the parser has\njust finished processing an open tag, so it is ready for text. Your ``write``\npasses 1K of text. You are not above the limit yet, so no event is generated\nyet. The next ``write`` passes another 1K of text. It so happens that sax checks\nbuffer limits only once per ``write``, after the chunk of data has been\nprocessed. Now you've hit the limit and you get a ``text`` event with 2K of\ndata. So even if you limit your ``write`` calls to the buffer limit you've set,\nyou may still get events with chunks at twice the buffer size limit you've\nspecified.\n\nWe may consider reinstating an equivalent functionality, provided that it\naddresses the issues above and does not cause a huge performance drop for\nuse-case scenarios that don't need it.",

This should not be used without some proxy that\n    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': true,\n\n    connection: {\n      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size\n\n      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy\n      autoSpdy31: false\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('hello world!');\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n```\n\nClient:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\nvar https = require('https');\n\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443,\n\n  // Optional SPDY options\n  spdy: {\n    plain: false,\n    ssl: true,\n\n    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'\n  }\n});\n\nhttps.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n  console.log('yikes');\n  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request\n  // ...\n  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server\n  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!\n  agent.close();\n}).end();\n```\n\nPlease note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level\nerrors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe\nto the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:\n\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443\n}).once('error', function (err) {\n  this.emit(err);\n});\n```\n\n#### Push streams\n\nIt is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_\nthe client requests it.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {\n    status: 200, // optional\n    method: 'GET', // optional\n    request: {\n      accept: '*/*'\n    },\n    response: {\n      'content-type': 'application/javascript'\n    }\n  });\n  stream.on('error', function() {\n  });\n  stream.end('alert(\"hello from push stream!\");');\n\n  res.end('<script src=\"/main.js\"></script>');\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response\nobject.  The signature of the `push()` method is:\n\n`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`\n\nSecond argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.\n`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a\n[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });\nvar req = http.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n});\nreq.on('push', function(stream) {\n  stream.on('error', function(err) {\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  // Read data from stream\n});\n```\n\nNOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`\ncallback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in\nuncaught exception and crash your program.\n\n#### Trailing headers\n\nServer usage:\n```javascript\nfunction (req, res) {\n  // Send trailing headers to client\n  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });\n\n  // On client's trailing headers\n  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}\n```\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {\n  // On server's trailing headers\n  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n});\nreq.write('stuff');\nreq.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });\nreq.end();\n```\n\n#### Options\n\nAll options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.\n\nAdditional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:\n\n* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether\n  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.\n* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used\n  as a `base` class for created server.\n* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA\n  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about\n  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.\n  (defaults to 8192)\n* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:\n  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)\n* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,\n* `maxStreams` - set \"[maximum concurrent streams][3]\" protocol option\n\n### API\n\nAPI is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another\nfunction as base class for SPDYServer.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(\n  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],\n  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument\n  [request listener]\n).listen([port], [host], [callback]);\n```\n\nRequest listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're\nboth instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three\ncustom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`\nis `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is\n`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,\n`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).\n\n\n#### Contributors\n\n* [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny)\n* [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c)\n* [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz)\n* [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)\n* [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg)\n* [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t)\n* [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To do an in-place\nsort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:\n\n```js\nconst arr = [10, 1, 5]\nstable(arr) === arr          // => false\nstable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true\n```\n\nA comparator function can be specified:\n\n```js\n// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.\n// This demonstrates the default behavior.\nconst lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)\nstable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']\n\n// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.\n// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.\nconst greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b\nstable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]\n```\n\n#### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you have a \"start server\", and \"test\" script names for example, you can start the server, wait for a url to respond, then run tests. When the test process exits, the server is shut down.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start-server\": \"npm start\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n        \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test start-server http://localhost:8080 test\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo execute all tests simply run `npm run ci`.\n\n### Commands\n\nIn addition to using NPM script names, you can pass entire commands (surround them with quotes so it is still a single string) that will be executed \"as is\". For example, to start globally installed `http-server` before running and recording [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) tests you can use\n\n```shell\n# run http-server, then when port 8000 responds run Cypress tests\nstart-server-and-test 'http-server -c-1 --silent' 8000 './node_modules/.bin/cypress run --record'\n```\n\nBecause `npm` scripts execute with `./node_modules/.bin` in the `$PATH`, you can mix global and locally installed tools when using commands inside `package.json` file. For example, if you want to run a single spec file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test 'http-server -c-1 --silent' 8080 'cypress run --spec cypress/integration/location.spec.js'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr you can move `http-server` part into its own `start` script, which is used by default and have the equivalent JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"http-server -c-1 --silent\",\n    \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test 8080 'cypress run --spec cypress/integration/location.spec.js'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere is another example that uses Mocha\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test 'http-server -c-1 --silent' 8080 'mocha e2e-spec.js'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Alias\n\nYou can use either `start-server-and-test`, `server-test` or `start-test` commands in your scripts.\n\nYou can use `:` in front of port number like `server-test :8080`, so all these are equivalent\n\n```\nstart-server-and-test start http://localhost:8080 test\nserver-test start http://localhost:8080 test\nserver-test http://localhost:8080 test\nstart-test :8080 test\nstart-test 8080 test\nstart-test 8080\n```\n\n### Options\n\nIf you use convention and name your scripts \"start\" and \"test\" you can simply provide URL\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"npm start\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n        \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test http://localhost:8080\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also shorten local url to just port, the code below is equivalent to checking `http://localhost:8080`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"npm start\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n        \"ci\": \"server-test 8080\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can provide first start command, port (or url) and implicit `test` command\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start-it\": \"npm start\",\n        \"test\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n        \"ci\": \"server-test start-it 8080\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can provide port number and custom test command, in that case `npm start` is assumed to start the server.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"start\": \"npm start\",\n        \"test-it\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n        \"ci\": \"server-test :9000 test-it\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can provide multiple resources to wait on, separated by a pipe `|`. _(be sure to wrap in quotes)_\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"npm start\",\n    \"test-it\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n    \"ci\": \"server-test \\\"8080|http://foo.com\\\"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nor for multiple ports simply: `server-test '8000|9000' test`.\n\nIf you want to start the server, wait for it to respond, and then run multiple test commands (and stop the server after they finish), you should be able to use `&&` to separate the test commands:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"npm start\",\n    \"test:unit\": \"mocha test.js\",\n    \"test:e2e\": \"mocha e2e.js\",\n    \"ci\": \"start-test 9000 'npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above script `ci` after the `localhost:9000` responds executes the `npm run test:unit` command. Then when it finishes it runs `npm run test:e2e`. If the first or second command fails, the `ci` script fails. Of course, your mileage on Windows might vary.\n\n## `npx` and `yarn`\n\nIf you have [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) available, you can execute locally installed tools from the shell. For example, if the `package.json` has the following local tools:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"cypress\": \"3.2.0\",\n    \"http-server\": \"0.11.1\",\n    \"start-server-and-test\": \"1.9.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can execute tests simply:\n\n```text\n$ npx start-test 'http-server -c-1 .' 8080 'cypress run'\nstarting server using command \"http-server -c-1 .\"\nand when url \"http://localhost:8080\" is responding\nrunning tests using command \"cypress run\"\nStarting up http-server, serving .\n...\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to call locally installed tools\n\n```text\n$ yarn start-test 'http-server -c-1 .' 8080 'cypress run'\nyarn run v1.13.0\n$ /private/tmp/test-t/node_modules/.bin/start-test 'http-server -c-1 .' 8080 'cypress run'\nstarting server using command \"http-server -c-1 .\"\nand when url \"http://localhost:8080\" is responding\nrunning tests using command \"cypress run\"\nStarting up http-server, serving .\n...\n```\n\n## Note for yarn users\n\nBy default, npm is used to run scripts, however you can specify that yarn is used as follows:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start-server\": \"yarn start\",\n    \"test\": \"mocha e2e-spec.js\",\n    \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test 'yarn start-server' http://localhost:8080 'yarn test'\"\n}\n```\n\n## Note for webpack-dev-server users\n\nIf you are using [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) (directly or via `angular/cli` or other boilerplates) then please use the following URL form to check\n\n```\nstart-server-and-test http-get://localhost:8080\n```\n\nThis is because under the hood this module uses [wait-on](https://github.com/jeffbski/wait-on) to ping the server. Wait-on uses `HEAD` by default, but `webpack-dev-server` does not respond to `HEAD` only to `GET` requests. Thus you need to use `http-get://` URL format to force `wait-on` to use `GET` probe.\n\nYou can even wait on the bundle JavaScript url instead of the page url, see discussion in this [issue #4](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test/issues/4)\n\n### Debugging\n\nTo see diagnostic messages, run with environment variable `DEBUG=start-server-and-test`\n\n### Disable HTTPS certificate checks\n\nTo disable HTTPS checks for `wait-on`, run with environment variable `START_SERVER_AND_TEST_INSECURE=1`.\n\n### Timeout\n\nThis utility will wait for maximum of 5 minutes while checking for the server to respond (default). Setting an environment variable `WAIT_ON_TIMEOUT=600000` (milliseconds) sets the timeout for example to 10 minutes.\n\n### Starting two servers\n\nSometimes you need to start one API server and one webserver in order to test the application. Use the syntax:\n\n```\nstart-test <first command> <first resource> <second command> <second resource> <test command>\n```\n\nFor example if API runs at port 3000 and server runs at port 8080:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"node src/test\",\n    \"start:api\": \"node src/api\",\n    \"start:server\": \"node src/server\",\n    \"test:all\": \"start-test start:api 3000 start:server 8080 test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example you would run `npm run test:all` to start the API first, then when it responds, start the server, and when the server is responding, it would run the tests. After the tests finish, it will shut down both servers. See the repo [start-two-servers-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-two-servers-example) for full example\n\n## Note for Apollo Server users\n\nWhen passing a simple GET request to Apollo Server it will respond with a 405 error. To get around this problem you need to pass a valid GraphQL query into the query parameter. Passing in a basic schema introspection query will work to determine the presence of an Apollo Server. You can configure your npm script like so:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ci\": \"start-server-and-test start 'http-get://localhost:4000/graphql?query={ __schema { queryType { name } } }' test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Small print\n\nAuthor: Gleb Bahmutov &lt;gleb.bahmutov@gmail.com&gt; &copy; 2017\n\n* [@bahmutov](https://twitter.com/bahmutov)\n* [glebbahmutov.com](https://glebbahmutov.com)\n* [blog](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog)\n\nLicense: MIT - do anything with the code, but don't blame me if it does not work.\n\nSupport: if you find any problems with this module, email / tweet /\n[open issue](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test/issues) on Github\n\n## MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Gleb Bahmutov &lt;gleb.bahmutov@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

Respectively, these are called like so:\n\n```javascript\nstore(key, data);                 // sets stringified data under key\nstore(key);                       // gets and parses data stored under key\nstore(key, fn[, alt]);            // run transaction function on/with data stored under key\nstore({key: data, key2: data2});  // sets all key/data pairs in the object\nstore();                          // gets all stored key/data pairs as an object\nstore((key, data)=>{ });          // calls function for each key/data in storage, return false to exit\nstore(false);                     // clears all items from storage\n```\n\nParameters in [brackets] are optional. There are also more explicit and versatile functions available:\n\n```javascript\nstore.set(key, data[, overwrite]); // === store(key, data);\nstore.setAll(data[, overwrite]);   // === store({key: data, key2: data});\nstore.get(key[, alt]);             // === store(key);\nstore.getAll([fillObj]);           // === store();\nstore.transact(key, fn[, alt]);    // === store(key, fn[, alt]);\nstore.clear();                     // === store(false);\nstore.has(key);                    // returns true or false\nstore.remove(key[, alt]);          // removes key and its data, then returns the data or alt, if none\nstore.each(fn[, fill]);            // === store(fn); optional call arg will be 3rd fn arg (e.g. for gathering values)\nstore.add(key, data);              // concats, merges, or adds new value into existing one\nstore.keys([fillList]);            // returns array of keys\nstore.size();                      // number of keys, not length of data\nstore.clearAll();                  // clears *ALL* areas (but still namespace sensitive)\n```\n\nPassing in ```false``` for the optional overwrite parameters will cause ```set``` actions to be skipped \nif the storage already has a value for that key. All ```set``` action methods return the previous value \nfor that key, by default. If overwrite is ```false``` and there is a previous value, the unused new \nvalue will be returned.\n\nAll functions which take an optional ```alt``` parameter can also use that parameter to specify a \"reviver\" function. These receive each key and value (yes, nested ones too) as arguments and allow you to provide an alternate means of parsing that string. This is particularly useful for rich objects like ```Date``` types. See [MDN's JSON.parse docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) for more information and examples. Alternately, you can set a global reviver to the ```store._.revive``` property to handle all ```get```, ```getAll```, and ```transact``` calls.\n\nFunctions passed to ```transact``` will receive the current value for that key as an argument or\na passed alternate if there is none. When the passed function is completed, transact will save the returned value\nunder the specified key. If the function returns ```undefined```, the original value will be saved.\nThis makes it easy for transact functions to change internal properties in a persistent way:\n\n```javascript\nstore.transact(key, function(obj) {\n    obj.changed = 'newValue';// this change will be persisted\n});\n```\n\nFunctions passed to ```each``` will receive the key as first argument and current value as the second; if a `fill` parameter is specified, it's value will be the third argument for every call (few should ever\nneed a `fill` parameter). If the function returns ```false``` at any point during the iteration, the\nloop will exit early and not continue on to the next key/value pair.\n\n```javascript\nstore.each(function(key, value) {\n    console.log(key, '->', value);\n    if (key === 'stopLoop') {\n        return false;// this will cause each to stop calling this function\n    }\n});\n```\n\nFor ```getAll``` and ```keys```, there is the option to pass in the object or list, respectively,\nthat you want the results to be added to. This is instead of an empty list.\nThere are only a few special cases where you are likely to need or want this,\nin general, most users should ignore these optional parameters.\nThese both use the  second, optional argument ```each``` function,\nwhich is also a niche feature. The ```value``` argument is passed as\nthe second arg to the callback function (in place of the data associated with the current key)\nand is returned at the end. Again, most users should not need this feature.\nAll of these use the browser's localStorage (aka \"local\"). Using sessionStorage merely requires \ncalling the same functions on ```store.session```:\n\n```javascript\nstore.session(\"addMeTo\", \"sessionStorage\");\nstore.local({lots: 'of', data: 'altogether'});// store.local === store :)\n```\nThere is also a store API automatically available for keeping non-persistent information,\nmeant only to last until page reload.\n```javascript\nstore.page(\"until\",\"reload\");\n```\n\nAll the specific ```get```, ```set```, etc. functions are available on ```store.session```, ```store.local```, and ```store.page```, as well as any other storage facility registered via ```store.area(name, customStorageObject)``` by an extension, where customStorageObject must implement the [Storage interface][storage]. This is how [store.old.js][old] extends store.js to support older versions of IE and Firefox.\n\n[storage]: http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-storage-interface\n\nIf you want to put stored data from different pages or areas of your site into separate namespaces, \nthe ```store.namespace(ns)``` function is your friend:\n\n```javascript\nvar cart = store.namespace('cart');\ncart('total', 23.25);// stores in localStorage as 'cart.total'\nconsole.log(store('cart.total') == cart('total'));// logs true\nconsole.log(store.cart.getAll());// logs {total: 23.25}\ncart.session('group', 'toys');// stores in sessionStorage as 'cart.group'\n```\n\nThe namespace provides the same exact API as ```store``` but silently adds/removes the namespace prefix as needed.\nIt also makes the namespaced API accessible directly via ```store[namespace]``` (e.g. ```store.cart```) as long as it\ndoes not conflict with an existing part of the store API.\n\nThe 'namespace' function is one of two \"extra\" functions that are also part of the \"store API\":\n\n```javascript\nstore.namespace(prefix);// returns a new store API that prefixes all key-based functions\nstore.isFake();// is this actually localStorage/sessionStorage or an in-memory fallback?\n```\n\nIf localStorage or sessionStorage are unavailable, they will be faked to prevent errors,\nbut data stored will NOT persist beyond the life of the current document/page. Use the \n[store.old.js][old] extension to add persistent backing for the store API in ancient browsers.\n\n## Extensions\nThese mostly could use further documentation and abuse...er...testing.\nContributions are welcome!\nIn particular, any ES6 user interested in making these [importable in ES6][es6importissue] would be appreciated.\n\n[es6importissue]: https://github.com/nbubna/store/issues/31\n\n#### Beta - Stable and definitely useful\n* [store.old.js][old] - Add working localStorage and sessionStorage polyfills for ancient browsers\n* [store.overflow.js][overflow] - Fall back to fake storage on quota errors\n* [store.cache.js][cache] - To make data expire, pass a number of seconds as the overwrite (third) param on ```set()``` calls\n* [store.on.js][on] - Superior storage event handling (per key, per namespace, etc in IE9+)\n* [store.array.js][array] - Easy, powerful array functions for any and all data (e.g. ```store.push(key, v1, v2)```).\n* [store.dom.js][dom] - Declarative, persistent DOM element content via store.\n\n#### Alpha - Either incomplete or unstable or both\n* [store.quota.js][quota] - Register callbacks to handle (and even cancel) quota errors\n* [store.measure.js][measure] - Experimental extension for measuring space used and available (needs work)\n* [store.onlyreal.js][onlyreal] - When only fake storage is available, silently fail instead of faking it.\n* [store.dot.js][dot] - Creates accessors for keys (e.g. ```store.foo == store.get('foo')```)\n* [store.deep.js][deep] - Allow retrieval of properties from within stored objects (e.g. ```store.get('key.property')```)\n* [store.async.js][async] - Adds ```store.async``` duplicate to each store and namespace that performs functions asynchronously and returns a Promise that resolves when complete.\n\n\n[old]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.old.js\n[overflow]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.overflow.js\n[cache]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.cache.js\n[on]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.on.js\n[quota]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.quota.js\n[measure]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.measure.js\n[onlyreal]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.onlyreal.js\n[array]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.array.js\n[dot]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.dot.js\n[deep]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.deep.js\n[dom]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.dom.js\n[async]: https://raw.github.com/nbubna/store/master/src/store.async.js\n\n#### Write Your Own Extension\nTo write your own extension, you can use or carefully override internal functions exposed as ```store._```.\nIn particular, the ```store._.fn(fnName, fn)``` method is available to automatically add your new function\nto every instance of the ```store``` interface (e.g. ```store```, ```store.session```\nand all existing and future namespaces). Take care using this, as it will override existing methods.\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```javascript\n(function(_) {\n    _.fn('falsy', function(key) {\n        return !this.get(key);\n    });\n    _.fn('truthy', function(key) {\n        return !this.falsy(key);\n    });\n})(store._);\n```\nThis extension would be used like so:\n```javascript\nstore('foo', 1);\nstore.falsy('foo'); // returns false\n\nstore.session('bar', 'one');\nstore.session.truthy('bar'); // return true;\n\nconst widgetStore = store.namespace('widget');\nwidgetStore.falsy('state'); // returns true\n```\n\n## Release History\n* 2010-02-10 v0.1 (extraction from esha.js)\n* 2010-05-25 v1.0 (internal release)\n* 2013-04-09 [v2.0.3][] (public) - First GitHub release\n* 2013-04-20 [v2.1.0][] (public) - Drops flawed/confusing/unused key(i) method, fixes extension problems.\n* 2013-04-30 [v2.1.1][] (public) - Browserify (and friends) support (module.exports = store)\n* 2013-05-30 [v2.1.2][] (public) - Component support (old component.json is now bower.json)\n* 2014-03-10 [v2.1.6][] (public) - AMD support and Component improvements\n* 2015-02-02 [v2.2.0][] (public) - Change store.cache.js to use seconds, not minutes.\n* 2015-05-05 [v2.2.1][] (public) - node.js compatibility\n* 2015-05-08 [v2.2.2][] (public) - Always expose global to allow extensions to always work.\n* 2015-05-22 [v2.3.0][] (public) - Use fake storage for Safari private mode (instead of letting quota exceptions go)\n* 2015-10-27 [v2.3.2][] (public) - Add source map\n* 2017-01-04 [v2.4.0][] (public) - Add store.transact(key, fn[, alt])\n* 2017-01-09 [v2.5.0][] (public) - Update for issue #34; new extensions (array, dot, and deep); only expose global in non-AMD/CommonJS environments (PR #35)\n* 2017-08-09 [v2.5.2][] (public) - Fix `clear()` in fake storage (thx to Martin Kluska)\n* 2018-01-18 [v2.5.11][] (public) - Add ```index.d.ts``` in root to provide TypeScript support\n* 2018-01-23 [v2.6.0][] (public) - Support ```each(fn,value)```, ```getAll(fillObj)```, and ```keys(fillList)``` to support some advanced/corner cases\n* 2018-11-15 [v2.7.1][] (public) - Add ```add(key, data)``` for common case of saving a combination of existing and new data.

Out of the box, you have two base themes, but you can simply add your custom themes like this:\n```js\n//.storybook/preview.js\n\nimport { muiTheme } from 'storybook-addon-material-ui'\n\n// Create your own theme like this.\n// Note: you can specify theme name in `themeName` field. Otherwise it will be displayed by the number.\n// you can specify only required fields overriding the `Light Base Theme`\nconst newTheme = {\n    themeName: 'Grey Theme',\n    palette: {\n        primary1Color: '#00bcd4',\n        alternateTextColor: '#4a4a4a',\n        canvasColor: '#616161',\n        textColor: '#bdbdbd',\n        secondaryTextColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.54)',\n        disabledColor: '#757575',\n        accent1Color: '#607d8b',\n    },\n};\n\n\nexport const decorators = [\n\tmuiTheme([newTheme])\n];\n\n```\nor even import from elsewhere\n```js\n//.storybook/preview.js\n\nimport { muiTheme } from 'storybook-addon-material-ui'\n\nimport theme1 from './src/theme/theme1'\nimport theme2 from './src/theme/theme2'\n\nexport const decorators = [\n\tmuiTheme([theme1, theme2])\n];\n\n```\n\n### Storybook 5 (and older versions)\nNow, write your stories with Material-UI Addon. By default your stories will be provided with [`Light Base Theme`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/styles/baseThemes/lightBaseTheme.js) and [`Dark Base Theme`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/styles/baseThemes/darkBaseTheme.js)\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { storiesOf, addDecorator } from '@storybook/react';\nimport {muiTheme} from 'storybook-addon-material-ui';\n\n// Import some examples from react-theming https://github.com/react-theming/react-theme-provider/blob/master/example/\nimport CardExampleControlled from '../CardExampleControlled.jsx';\nimport RaisedButtonExampleSimple from '../RaisedButtonExampleSimple.jsx';\nimport DatePickerExampleSimple from '../DatePickerExampleSimple.jsx';\n\nstoriesOf('Material-UI', module)\n// Add the `muiTheme` decorator to provide material-ui support to your stories.\n// If you do not specify any arguments it starts with two default themes\n// You can also configure `muiTheme` as a global decorator.\n    .addDecorator(muiTheme())\n    .add('Card Example Controlled', () => (\n            <CardExampleControlled />\n        ))\n    .add('Raised Button Example Simple', () => (\n            <RaisedButtonExampleSimple />\n        ))\n    .add('Date Picker Example Simple', () => (\n            <DatePickerExampleSimple />\n        ));\n```\n> Note : You can switch between the loaded themes.

    "licenseText": "# TeleJSON\n\nA library for teleporting rich data to another place.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nyarn add telejson\n```\n\n## What can it do, what can't it do:\n\n`JSON.parse` & `JSON.stringify` have limitation by design, because there are no data formats for things like\n\n- Date\n- Function\n- Class\n- Symbol\n- etc.\n\nAlso JSON doesn't support cyclic data structures.\n\nThis library allows you to pass in data with all all the above properties.\nIt will transform the properties to something that's allowed by the JSON spec whilst stringifying,\nand then convert back to the cyclic data structure when parsing.\n\nWhen parsing, **class instances** will be given the Class's name again.\nThe prototype isn't copied over.\n\n**Functions** are supported, they are stringified and will be eval-ed when called.\nThis lazy eval is important for performance.\nThe eval happens via `eval()`\nFunctions are stripped of comments and whitespace.\n\n> Obviously calling the function will only really work as expected if the functions were pure the begin with.\n\n**Regular expressions** just work.\n\n**Symbol** will be re-created with the same string. (resulting in a similar, but different symbol)\n\n**Dates** are parsed back into actual Date objects.\n\n**DOM Events** are processed to extract the internal (hidden) properties, resulting in an object containing the same properties but not being an instance of the original class.\n\n## API\n\nYou have 2 choices:\n\n```js\nimport { stringify, parse } from 'telejson';\n\nconst Foo = function () {};\n\nconst root = {\n  date: new Date('2018'),\n  regex1: /foo/,\n  regex2: /foo/g,\n  regex2: new RegExp('foo', 'i'),\n  fn1: () => 'foo',\n  fn2: function fn2() {\n    return 'foo';\n  },\n  Foo: new Foo(),\n};\n\n// something cyclic\nroot.root = root;\n\nconst stringified = stringify(root);\nconst parsed = parse(stringified);\n```\n\nstringify and parse do not conform to the JSON.stringify or JSON.parse api.\nthey take an data object and a option object.\n\nOR you can use use the `replacer` and `reviver`:\n\n```js\nimport { replacer, reviver } from 'telejson';\nimport data from 'somewhere';\n\nconst stringified = JSON.stringify(data, replacer(), 2);\nconst parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver(), 2);\n```\n\nnotice that both replacer and reviver need to be called! doing the following will NOT WORK:\n\n```\nconst stringified = JSON.stringify(data, replacer, 2);\nconst parsed = JSON.parse(stringified, reviver, 2);\n```\n\n## options\n\nYou either pass the options-object to `replacer` or as a second argument to `stringify`:\n\n```js\nreplacer({ maxDepth: 10 });\nstringify(date, { maxDepth: 10 });\n```\n\n### replacer\n\n`maxDepth`: controls how deep to keep stringifying. When max depth is reach,\nobjects will be replaced with `\"[Object]\"`, arrays will be replaced with `\"[Array(<length>)]\"`.\ndefault value is `10`\nThis option is really useful if your object is huge/complex, and you don't care about the deeply nested data.\n\n`space`: controls how to prettify the output string.\ndefault value is `undefined`, no white space is used.\nOnly relevant when using `stringify`.\n\n`allowFunction`: When set to false, functions will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n`allowRegExp`: When set to false, regular expressions will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n`allowClass`: When set to false, class instances will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n`allowDate`: When set to false, Date objects will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n`allowUndefined`: When set to false, `undefined` will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n`allowSymbol`: When set to false, Symbols will not be serialized. (default = true)\n\n### reviver\n\n`lazyEval`: When set to false, lazy eval will be disabled. (default true)\n\nNote: disabling lazy eval will affect performance. Consider disabling it only if you truly need to.\n\n## Requirements\n\n`telejson` depends on the collection type `Map`. If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (e.g. IE < 11) or which have non-compliant implementations (e.g. IE 11), consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application, such as `core-js` or `babel-polyfill`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please open an issue.\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\n### run tests:\n\n```sh\nyarn test\n```",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

It acts the same as Record from TS's standard library\nexport type DummyOptions = \"open\" | \"closed\" | \"unknown\";\nconst dictFromUnionType: Dictionary<number, DummyOptions> = {\n  closed: 1,\n  open: 2,\n  unknown: 3,\n};\n\n// and get dictionary values\ntype stringDictValues = DictionaryValues<typeof stringDict>;\n// Result: string\n```\n\n### Deep Partial & Deep Required & Deep Readonly\n\n```typescript\ntype ComplexObject = {\n  simple: number;\n  nested: {\n    a: string;\n    array: [{ bar: number }];\n  };\n};\n\ntype ComplexObjectPartial = DeepPartial<ComplexObject>;\nconst samplePartial: ComplexObjectPartial = {\n  nested: {\n    array: [{}],\n  },\n};\n\ntype ComplexObjectAgain = DeepRequired<ComplexObjectPartial>;\nconst sampleRequired: ComplexObjectAgain = {\n  simple: 5,\n  nested: {\n    a: \"test\",\n    array: [],\n  },\n};\n\ntype ComplexObjectReadonly = DeepReadonly<ComplexObject>;\n```\n\n### Writable\n\nMake all attributes of object writable.\n\n```typescript\ntype Foo = {\n  readonly a: number;\n  readonly b: string;\n};\n\nconst foo: Foo = ({ a: 1, b: \"b\" }(foo as Writable<typeof foo>).a = 42);\n```\n\n```typescript\ntype Foo = {\n  readonly foo: string;\n  bar: {\n    readonly x: number;\n  };\n}[];\n\nconst test: DeepWritable<Foo> = [\n  {\n    foo: \"a\",\n    bar: {\n      x: 5,\n    },\n  },\n];\n\n// we can freely write to this object\ntest[0].foo = \"b\";\ntest[0].bar.x = 2;\n```\n\n### Omit\n\nNOTE: Builtin `Omit` became part of TypeScript 3.5\n\n```typescript\ntype ComplexObject = {\n  simple: number;\n  nested: {\n    a: string;\n    array: [{ bar: number }];\n  };\n};\n\ntype SimplifiedComplexObject = Omit<ComplexObject, \"nested\">;\n\n// Result:\n// {\n//  simple: number\n// }\n\n// if you want to Omit multiple properties just use union type:\ntype SimplifiedComplexObject = Omit<ComplexObject, \"nested\" | \"simple\">;\n\n// Result:\n// { } (empty type)\n```\n\n### OmitProperties\n\nRemoves all properties extending type `P` in type `T`.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Example {\n  log(): void;\n  version: string;\n}\n\ntype ExampleWithoutMethods = OmitProperties<Example, Function>;\n\n// Result:\n// {\n//   version: string;\n// }\n\n// if you want to Omit multiple properties just use union type like\n\ntype ExampleWithoutMethods = OmitProperties<Example, Function | string>;\n// Result:\n// { } (empty type)\n\n```\n\n### NonNever\n\nUseful for purifying object types. It improves intellisense but also allows for extracting keys satisfying a conditional\ntype.\n\n```typescript\ntype GetDefined<TypesMap extends { [key: string]: any }> = keyof NonNever<\n  { [T in keyof TypesMap]: TypesMap[T] extends undefined ? never : TypesMap[T] }\n>;\n```\n\n### Merge\n\n```typescript\ntype Foo = {\n  a: number;\n  b: string;\n};\n\ntype Bar = {\n  b: number;\n};\n\nconst xyz: Merge<Foo, Bar> = { a: 4, b: 2 };\n// Result:\n// {\n//   a: number,\n//   b: number,\n// }\n```\n\n### MarkRequired\n\nUseful when you're sure some optional properties will be set. A real life example: when selecting\nan object with its related entities from an ORM.\n\n```typescript\nclass User {\n  id: number;\n  posts?: Post[];\n  photos?: Photo[];\n}\ntype UserWithPosts = MarkRequired<User, 'posts'>;\n\n// example usage with a TypeORM repository -- `posts` are now required, `photos` are still optional\nasync function getUserWithPosts(id: number): Promise<UserWithPosts> {\n  return userRepo.findOneOrFail({ id }, { relations: ['posts'] }) as Promise<UserWithPosts>;\n}\n```\n\n### ReadonlyKeys\n\nGets keys of an object which are readonly.\n\n```typescript\ntype T = {\n  readonly a: number;\n  b: string;\n};\ntype Result = ReadonlyKeys<T>\n// Result:\n// \"a\"\n```\n\n### WritableKeys\n\nGets keys of an object which are writable.\n\n```typescript\ntype T = {\n  readonly a: number;\n  b: string;\n};\ntype Result = WritableKeys<T>\n// Result:\n// \"b\"\n```\n\n### UnionToIntersection\n\nUseful for converting mapped types with function values to intersection type (so in this case - overloaded function).\n\n```typescript\ntype Foo = {\n  bar: string;\n  xyz: number;\n};\n\ntype Fn = UnionToIntersection<{ [K in keyof Foo]: (type: K, arg: Foo[K]) => any }[keyof Foo]>;\n```\n\n### Opaque types\n\n```typescript\ntype PositiveNumber = Opaque<number, \"positive-number\">;\n\nfunction makePositiveNumber(n: number): PositiveNumber {\n  if (n <= 0) {\n    throw new Error(\"Value not positive !!!\");\n  }\n  return (n as any) as PositiveNumber; // this ugly cast is required but only when \"producing\" opaque types\n}\n```\n\n### Tuple constraint\n\n```typescript\nfunction foo<T extends Tuple>(tuple: T): T {\n  return tuple;\n}\n\nconst ret = foo([\"s\", 1]);\n// return type of [string, number]\n```\n\nYou can also parametrize `Tuple` type with a type argument to constraint it to certain types, i.e.\n`Tuple<string | number>`.\n\n### Literal types\n\n_For TypeScript >= 3.4_: TypeScript 3.4 shipped\n[`const` assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html) which are very\nsimilar to our `literal` helper but also make type readonly, you should prefer `as const` construct.\n\n_For TypeScript < 3.4_: this is served as a backport of the [`const` assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html) added since TypeScript 3.4.\n\n```typescript\n// prevent type widening https://blog.mariusschulz.com/2017/02/04/typescript-2-1-literal-type-widening\nconst t = {\n  letter: literal(\"a\"), // type stays \"a\" not string\n  digit: literal(5), // type stays 5 not number\n};\n```\n\n### Exhaustive switch cases\n\n```typescript\nfunction actOnDummyOptions(options: DummyOptions): string {\n  switch (options) {\n    case \"open\":\n      return \"it's open!\";\n    case \"closed\":\n      return \"it's closed\";\n    case \"unknown\":\n      return \"i have no idea\";\n    default:\n      // if you would add another option to DummyOptions, you'll get error here!\n      throw new UnreachableCaseError(options);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ValueOf type\n\n```typescript\nconst obj = {\n  id: \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000\",\n  name: \"Test object\",\n  timestamp: 1548768231486,\n};\n\ntype objKeys = ValueOf<typeof obj>;\n// Result: string | number\n```\n\n### AsyncOrSync type\n\nUseful as a return type in interfaces or abstract classes with missing implementation\n\n```typescript\ninterface CiProvider {\n  getSHA(): AsyncOrSync<string>;\n  // same as\n  getSHA(): Promise<string> | string;\n}\n\nclass Circle implements CiProvider {\n  // implementation can use sync version\n  getSHA() {\n    return \"abc\";\n  }\n}\n\nclass Travis implements CiProvider {\n  // implementation can use async version when needed\n  async getSHA() {\n    // do async call\n    return \"def\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# <img src=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/images/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png\" height=\"40\" align=\"right\" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for TypeScript\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)\n[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)\n\n*This plugin is also available for Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin)), Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), and Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve))*\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nyarn add -D ts-pnp\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n*Note that `ts-pnp` is a low-level package - you shouldn't have to use it unless you're writing a TS compiler host. If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work™, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*\n\nThis package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.\n\n```js\nimport {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';\nimport * as ts from 'typescript';\n\nfunction createCompilerHost(\n  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,\n): ts.CompilerHost {\n  const compilerHost = {\n    resolveModuleNames,\n    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,\n  };\n\n  return compilerHost;\n\n  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;\n    });\n  }\n\n  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {\n    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {\n      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## License (MIT)\n\n> **Copyright © 2016 Maël Nison**\n>\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n>\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n>\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "`WeakMap` is a collection slated to be introduced to JavaScript with\nEcmaScript 6.  It provides a mapping from objects to values, but allows\nany entry to be garbage collected if the key is provably lost.\n\nIn order for it to be possible that a key is provably lost, weak maps do\nnot provide a way to access the key list.\n\nThis is a Node Packaged Module (NPM) that provides a shim and patcher\nfor missing or broken WeakMap implementations suitable for use in\nNode.js and browsers that provide the EcmaScript 5 property description\ninterfaces provided that it hosted by a CommonJS loader or bundler like\n[Browserify][], [Montage][], [Mr][], or [Mop][].\n\n[Browserify]: https://github.com/substack/node-browserify\n[Montage]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr\n[Mr]: https://github.com/montagejs/mr\n[Mop]: https://github.com/montagejs/mop\n\n```\nnpm install weak-map --save\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar WeakMap = require(\"weak-map\");\nvar map = new WeakMap();\nvar key = {};\nmap.set(key, \"Hello, World!\");\nmap.get(key) === \"Hello, World!\";\nkey = null;\n// \"Hello, World!\" may be collected\n```\n\nSee [MDN][] for the API details.\n\n[MDN]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap\n\nAt time of writing, prototype implementations of `WeakMap` exist in V8\nand Spidermonkey.  The prototype is available in Node.js v0.10 with the\n`--harmony_collections` V8 option.  In v0.8, it was available with\n`--harmony_weakmaps`.  The purpose of this package is to enable\ndependees to use weak maps regardless of whether they are implemented by\nthe underlying engine, albeit in a way that leaks memory in some\nnon-obvious cases.\n\n### Purpose and limitation\n\nThis shim depends on and modifies ECMAScript 5 property descriptor related\nmethods, `Object.defineProperty`, `Object.getOwnPropertyNames`,\n`Object.isExtensible`, `Object.freeze`, and `Object.seal`.\n\nIn a nutshell, the WeakMap shim emulates a WeakMap by adding a hidden\nproperty to the key that associates the weak map with the retained\nobject. The shim overrides the ECMAScript 5 methods to cover its tracks.\n\nConsider a scenario that only includes a weak map, a key, and a corresponding\nvalue through the weak map. With a proper `WeakMap`, built into the JavaScript\nengine privy to the internals of the garbage collector, the `value` would be\nretained either by the key or the weak map. If *either* the key or the weak map\nare elligible for garbage collection, the value is elligible.\n\nThis is in contrast to to a plain `Map`. In a scenario with a map, a key, and a\nvalue corresponding to the key through the map, neither the key nor the value\nwill be eligible for garbage collection until the map containing them is\nelligible. Thus, if a map is used to establish a relationship between ephemeral\nkeys and values, it will accumulate garbage.\n\nThis shim does its best to approximate a proper `WeakMap` without an intimate\nrelationship with the garbage collector. In the same scenario, the value will\nbecome elligible for garbage collection if the key is elligible. Unlike a proper\nweak map, if the weak map shim becomes elligible for garbage collection but the\nkey is retained by something else, the value will be retained. In this scenario,\nall operations of the weak map take constant time.\n\nHowever, if the key is *frozen*, the weak map retains both the key and the value\nand neither are elligible for collection until the weak map becomes elligible\nitself. This scenario is unfortunately identical to the behavior of a `Map`.\nAdditionally, all operations of the weak map suffer linear time.\n\nAs stated by Mark Miller in the code:\n\n> As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not retain maps indexed by\n> that key and (crucially) a map does not retain the keys it indexes. A map by\n> itself also does not retain the values associated with that map.\n>\n> However, the values associated with a key in some map are retained so long as\n> that key is retained and those associations are not overridden. For example,\n> when used to support membranes, all values exported from a given membrane will\n> live for the lifetime they would have had in the absence of an interposed\n> membrane. Even when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n> reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as far as the\n> GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant to ongoing\n> computation.\n>\n> The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n> in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n> rather than the offially approved proposal page.\n>\n> The first difference between the emulation here and that in FF6.0a1 is the\n> presence of non enumerable `get___`, `has___`, `set___`, and `delete___`}\n> methods on WeakMap instances to represent what would be the hidden internal\n> properties of a primitive implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype\n> methods require their `this` to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e., an object\n> of `[[Class]]` \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing unforgeable about the\n> pseudo-internal method names used here, nothing prevents these emulated\n> prototype methods from being applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal\n> methods of the same names.\n>\n> Another difference is that our emulated `WeakMap.prototype` is not itself a\n> WeakMap. A problem with the current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is\n> itself a WeakMap providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n> channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this problem,\n> repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to prevent access to this\n> channel. (See PATCH_MUTABLE_FROZEN_WEAKMAP_PROTO in repairES5.js).\n\nThis refers to `repairES5.js` as provided by Google Caja.\n\n### Origin and license\n\nThe canonical implementation of `WeakMap` exists in the Google Caja\nSubversion repository at http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.\nIt was written by Mark S. Miller.  It is released by Google with the\nApache 2.0 license.  This package is maintained by Kris Kowal.\n\nThis work began with [Mark Miller’s proposal][Proposal] for `WeakMap` to ECMA’s\nTC-39, where the JavaScript standard is developed.\n\n[Proposal]: http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
